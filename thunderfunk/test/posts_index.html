              <div class="entry-content">
                <p id="3104" class="graf--p graf--first">If the Internet is an ocean, I am a fish. This is where much of my life has been lived, and so I have grown to love it, warts and all. It has enabled, for me, that which I love most in the world: endless knowledge and learning. I never went to university — my education has been largely digital, from beginning to end. Some of my earliest memories are of exploring Encyclopedia Britannica, watching animations about windmills and levies. I remember the first day I found Wikipedia — I immediately went on a 2-hour dive through black holes on through retinas and cow-tipping. I just couldn’t believe that such an expansive resource existed. Everything I know about design and programming has been learned online. I’ve devoted thousands of hours to lectures and documentaries. For me, computers and the Internet really are a bottomless spring of knowledge and ideas.</p>
                <p id="0f98" class="graf--p">This isn’t how many people see or use the Internet. For a time, this irked me, similar to the way a dancer might feel about someone who’s never danced — something of intrinsic value, perhaps not <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">actually </em>essential to modern life. Today, however, there is no question that the Internet is a central component of so many of our daily routines and exchanges. Watching this growth, that irksome feeling has steadily grown into a deep concern for the ways computers are failing to unite us, or even creating divisions where before none existed. While the Internet opens up rich new channels of exploration and connection, others seem to be closing.</p>
                <p id="5704" class="graf--p">One beauty of the Internet is that you can, at this very moment, go to YouTube and find all manner of skills demonstrated by people around the world. Your Facebook feed is likely sprinkled with photos of various hobbies, projects, and achievements. And it’s all inferior to experiencing things in real life. The online conversations we share about these activities — particularly with friends and family — are often unsatisfying, lifeless and primitive imitations of real world communication.</p>
                <p id="840a" class="graf--p">For some people, their purest and most powerful form of expression is with a paintbrush. For others, it’s a guitar. A basketball. A pen. A sewing needle. A steering wheel. A deck of cards. Pick whatever you want — there’s someone, somewhere who could stun you with their mastery over these inert objects, that could expose you to new thoughts and ideas through the creative expression realized in their demonstration. It’s passions and talents like these that weave the fabric of culture and enrich the human experience. But on the Internet, these skills are worth only their weight in views and likes.</p>
                <p id="f31c" class="graf--p">Imagine if you were to meet an elite pianist. She tells you about her favorite piece, and how much she loves to perform it for others. Gesturing to a piano, she offers to give you a demonstration. She sits down at the bench, pulls out her phone, and shows you a YouTube recording of her performance. The feeling this bait-and-switch gives you? That’s the emotional gap between watching a video and having a genuine experience. It’s what we accept for much of our intimate interactions in the year 2015.</p>
                <p id="504f" class="graf--p">Perhaps a glib metaphor — but I genuinely believe computers, tablets, and phones are failing to engage us as human beings. Our methods of interaction with modern technology are simple and rigid, especially when compared with the limitless dexterity of the human hand. Most of our communication starts with clicking, scrolling, swiping, and typing. These basic actions are the gateway to everything that everyone does online. All that we do, all that we are, is being entirely channeled through a keyboard, and what we get back is imprisoned behind a flat piece of glass.</p>
                <p id="25a7" class="graf--p">The reason this matters is that behind the glass plate, connections to the rest of the world await. Vast sums of knowledge are there for the taking. But many people will never venture far past that glass, because they want to be in the real world. They want to use their hands — not just their index finger. They want to be with people, face-to-face, in the flesh. They want to experience the world in context. These should not be qualities that separate anyone from the acquisition of knowledge.</p>
                <p id="bd31" class="graf--p">Few people genuinely say “I <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">never</em> want to learn about science” or “I wish I knew <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">less</em> about what was going on in the world”. What we’re resistant to is the time and effort required, especially when life is already so relentless and exhausting. Maybe cynicism pushes us to a point of apathy or despair, where we lack the inclination to even feign intrigue, but this is a separate issue. Humans are generally curious and love to learn. Where we differ is in how this curiosity is exposed and in what methods of learning are most effective. Given the right environment with meaningful engagement, you can get most people excited about complex, even esoteric subjects.</p>
                <p id="a2e0" class="graf--p">I don’t just mean <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://www.earthprimer.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-href="http://www.earthprimer.com/">fancy iPad apps</a> or <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://tobyschachman.com/Shadershop/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-href="http://tobyschachman.com/Shadershop/">intuitive interfaces for complex mathematics</a>. These are important and necessary, but they’re just the next step.</p>
                <p id="3821" class="graf--p">I’m talking <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://new.livestream.com/cdmschool/events/3167937/videos/55979749" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-href="http://new.livestream.com/cdmschool/events/3167937/videos/55979749">chalkboards that understand shapes and objects</a>. We can empower people to communicate bigger, more complicated ideas with greater ease and clarity.</p>
                <p id="0e0e" class="graf--p">Combine this with <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-P1zZAcPuw" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-P1zZAcPuw">interactive holographs</a>, <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smai_Z_galE" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smai_Z_galE">pneumatic interfaces</a>, and<a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://vimeo.com/79179138" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-href="https://vimeo.com/79179138">dynamic shape displays</a>. We can leave the plate of glass behind entirely, bringing abstract phenomenon directly into the real world, allowing us not just to visualize, but to interact and play with complex models. Calculus, cell biology, and organic chemistry could cease to be locked behind variables and formulas, but could transform into the beautiful and dynamic processes they really are, in ways that <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">everyone </em>can understand.</p>
                <p id="55b6" class="graf--p">Throw in some <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyMowPAJwqo" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyMowPAJwqo">programmable soft-bodied robots</a> with <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67qhphkkibo" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67qhphkkibo">3D printed parts</a>. 3D printing alone represents enormous possibility, especially if mixed with advancements in interface design. Robots — even simple ones — advance this in unimaginable ways. Everyone, young and old, could share an equivalent ability to enact change on their environment. I really think that’s possible.</p>
                <p id="3dbd" class="graf--p">Last but not least, <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/3/1/8127445/htc-vive-valve-vr-headset" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/3/1/8127445/htc-vive-valve-vr-headset">virtual</a> and <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality">augmented reality</a> are just around the corner. Implemented correctly, augmented reality could mean the whole world can be explained and enhanced. For a long time I used a little plugin for Trillian that would automatically link any words in a conversation to a Wikipedia article, viewable on hover. I found it to be very empowering, especially in conversing with people much older than myself, where they would frequently use terms and references I didn’t know. We can do that in three dimensions. We can identify objects in our environment, and give people the tools to analyze and understand these objects. Whatever HUD we’ve seen in movies pales in comparison to what is actually possible with these technologies.</p>
                <p id="3430" class="graf--p">We could move beyond sharing recordings of experiences, to sharing experiences in real-time. We could completely abandon phones and keyboards for interfaces that adapt to us, wherever we are, whatever we need. Our technology could help us make decisions, rather than giving us more decisions to make. The basis of our relationship with computers could no longer be one of frustration and struggle, but fundamentally empowering throughout our lives.</p>
                <p id="8533" class="graf--p">This is a lot of idealistic hyperbole, I admit. Maybe none of these things will catch on, perhaps for very realistic and practical reasons. But it all lends hope to the idea that one day, we can make technology that works well for everyone, that gives people more ways to interact than just words, pictures, and videos that we numbly jab our fingers at.</p>
                <p id="89ea" class="graf--p">In 2015, these are not challenges that our devices are equipped to tackle. It would truly be a miserable condition to stay where we are now, and we won’t replace them if we begin to believe that they are at all sufficient. These phones and tablets are, in the grand scheme, meager inventions that should insult our dignity as the most advanced sentient species on the planet. Impressive as these devices are, we are capable of far better.</p>
                <p id="ef83" class="graf--p">I would love to try and prognosticate further what precisely this looks like, but I have read enough <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://io9.com/5908600/how-our-predictions-for-the-year-2000-changed-throughout-the-20th-century" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-href="http://io9.com/5908600/how-our-predictions-for-the-year-2000-changed-throughout-the-20th-century">magazines from the 1950’s</a> to know better. The possibilities really are infinite. If the human race can master these tools, if we can spread universal understanding of the world’s basic machinations, if we can identify and encourage the natural talents of individuals, and if we can foster meaningful sharing and serious collaboration on mass scales — god, <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">just imagine that world.</em> It is a place worth pursuing whole-heartedly.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>I’m a huge fan of Anita Sarkeesian’s Tropes vs Women in Video Games series. Although I highly recommend them to anyone with a serious interest in pop culture or video games, the series is quite long. Since this post involves many of its core ideas, I’ll provide my summary of Sarkeesian’s most important observations.</p>
<p>Video games and the industry surrounding them are extremely male-dominated. Games aren’t just being marketed exclusively towards men — games themselves are designed around the assumption that the players are male. They overwhelmingly cater to this group to such an extent that it is actively alienating the players that do not match this target demographic. A huge number of regressive attitudes and stereotypes are being actively perpetuated as a result. Here are some of the trends that Sarkeesian identifies:</p>
<ul>
<li>The main playable character in most games is male. If an option for a female character exists, she almost never has a different personality or any unique characteristics. In almost all cases, the male version was designed first, and the female is only a slight mutation of the male.</li>
<li>The majority of secondary characters, enemies, villains, and NPCs are male. For the few females that do appear, they usually draw from a small subset of inaccurate and simplistic stereotypes — pink, ribbons, flowers, hearts, big boobs, and short skirts. Female body types rarely deviate from the norms of thin, athletic, curvy, and symmetrical, while male body types can be seen in great variety — from emaciated to obese, beautiful to grotesque, to the deformed, lopsided, bizarre, and fantastical.</li>
<li>Whether they’re active characters or just background, women often only enter a game’s narrative as barely more than plot devices, sex objects, and emotional triggers. Casual depictions of rape and abuse are disturbingly frequent, existing not to examine or explore the reality of those experiences, but as cheap ways to add an emotional edge to a story or character.</li>
<li>The kicker is that it’s not just a handful of games doing this. No, in fact, the majority of games are participants here. Sarkeesian uses an enormous number of examples from a wide variety of games to illustrate these points. It’s a series backed by endless amounts of research, and it demolishes the notion that these are just isolated incidents, outliers in an landscape that generally respects the full diversity of human experience and anatomy equally.</li>
</ul>
<p>The universality of this pattern is what really demands focus. If it were only the case that a handful of games demonstrated this pattern, it might not be an issue at all. Everyone has their thing, and some people genuinely enjoy rescuing the damsel in distress, or find their heart wrenched every time the girlfriend is murdered by the villain. As a child, I certainly found these narratives compelling — I remember how distraught I was at age 8 when Ares died in Final Fantasy VII. Today I might find it lame and uncreative, but no more than BuzzFeed, reality TV, or an issue of Cosmo — and I’m not about to start making value judgments about the people that consume such media. The core problem is that it is truly pervasive to the point of excluding opportunities for alternative styles, expressions, and themes. For the majority of games to participate indicates a more fundamental truth about the culture surrounding video games.</p>
<p><strong>Why does this matter?</strong></p>
<p>I hate this question. It’s stupid that it has to be answered, but there are so many people that don’t get it that it has to be addressed before going on. Rather than adding another deconstruction of patriarchy to the Internet’s annals, let me provide a thought experiment that should help make the issue more self-evident to men who don’t see the problem. Reverse everything that’s just been described about gender in games. Do one massive find and replace for “male” with “female” and vice versa.</p>
<p>Brace yourself. Don’t say I didn’t warn you.</p>
<p><em>Imagine a young boy, nine or ten years of age, sitting down to play the newest critically-acclaimed AAA action game. The front cover of the game features the protagonist, a sleek and athletic woman, posed fiercely in a sharply-designed outfit with many layers. He loads the game and his only option is to play as a woman. In the opening cinematic of the game, we see the protagonist and her boyfriend walking along the beach together. Her boyfriend looks like Arnold Schwarzenegger in his mid 20’s and wears nothing but a banana hammock. The developers have gone to great lengths to achieve realistic schlong physics, and here we can see they have succeeded with splendor.</em></p>
<p><em> The first dialogue comes from the protagonist, a wistful reflection on her success as both an assassin as well as particle physicist. The camera switches to the boyfriend — the view is from the ground up, so half of the screen is consumed by the silhouette of the boyfriend’s junk, cradled by elastic fabric. The boyfriend responds by expressing his intense love for cars, and also guns. He requests that the protagonist should buy more cars and guns for him. As the boyfriend speaks, he flexes his biceps and begins to gyrate his hips, consuming even more of the screen with the gentle, well-animated sway of thinly veiled man-meat.</em></p>
<p><em> But before the boyfriend can even finish his sentence or any of us have learned his name, his young, hot body is plucked away effortlessly by the dastardly villain. The boyfriend is helpless and unable to fend for himself, and begs the protagonist to save him. The villain, an elderly woman with an extravagant character design and quirky personality, carts the boyfriend away to her secret lair. There we can see the villain has captured dozens, if not hundreds of male bodybuilders clad in banana hammocks. The framerate plunges as the game desperately tries to model the physics of this sausage factory.</em></p>
<p>Continuing the role reversal a little further with some follow-up questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How should the young boy feel if, in every single game, he was forced to play as a woman, where all of the men were depicted as shallow, homogeneously attractive, helpless morons, and the badass, witty, and unique characters were all women?</li>
<li>What should he conclude about his own self-image, the person that he should be, when the only representations of his gender are nothing like him?</li>
<li>What should girls conclude about their relationship to boys? What part of these games would do anything but reinforce the notion that they are more important, if not outright superior to boys?</li>
<li>Would he continue playing games at all, given that they were so clearly designed for girls rather than boys?</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s this last question that really haunts me. How many people have turned away from gaming because they felt unrepresented and unwanted? We’ll never know, and that’s a tragedy.</p>
<p>It’s important to understand how little this exaggerates the current state of many video games. Again, the problem is not that this game exists, but that the majority of games participate in this kind of one-dimensional and childish portrayal of gender.</p>
<p><strong>Why does this happen?</strong></p>
<p>The first thing that demands mentioning is that the video games industry, particularly where development is concerned, is very male-dominated, even in contrast to the technology sector as a whole (which already trends male). When human beings create, they draw first from their own knowledge and experiences, and that means male perspectives and priorities are going to be favored. While a more diverse workforce would no doubt contribute to a better awareness of these trends, this gives us very little perspective on why, in the end, games contain these biases.</p>
<p>This is where I start to part ways with Sarkeesian a bit. She describes the problem in terms of patriarchy and power fantasies. While I agree that these factors are real, the vocabulary of sociology and feminism are functionally useless to the people that most need to understand what’s going on. I also think she tends to attribute to malice (sexism) what can be more easily explained by neglect.</p>
<p>The issue must be approached from the most practical angle possible: how video games are created. Specifically, we need to examine the way video games are written —not the code, but the universe, themes, stories, plot, characters, and dialogue. But the fact is that writing is among the lowest of concerns when it comes to video game development. Games are one of the most difficult and complex systems to create. Early games, in particular, which were often written purely in assembly or other primitive languages, were incredible technical achievements. Even today, to create interactive software that runs smoothly, never crashing or glitching, with rich color and sound, unique level design, and pixel-perfect mechanics? This is, first and foremost, a task that requires talented engineers — people who may or may not have any skill or experience whatsoever in creative story-telling.</p>
<p>In movies, we can frequently see trade-offs between technical complexity and quality narrative. I find Michael Bay to be a useful comparison here. His vision and desire for movies is fairly straight-forward, as one such quote of his might illustrate:</p>
<p><em>“I love doing big movies. It’s awesome! You have all these toys. The thing I like about this movie is, like they always say, directors have the biggest train sets!”</em></p>
<p>The characters in the movies Michael Bay directs are one-dimensional. The plots are abysmal and mind-numbingly predictable. The dialogue rarely surpasses the level of skin-deep tropes and knee-jerk reactions. But no one can ever argue that his movies have poor special effects. The explosions are grand and numerous, the animation is fluid and expressive. That’s where the focus is placed — not on the writing, but on the visuals.</p>
<p>No one buys a ticket to a Michael Bay movie expecting anything different. Or rather, if they do, it’s their own fault when they discover that the plot is uncompelling and the relationships are simplistic and barely recognizable as anything we might find in real life. They exist only to provide the minimum connection necessary to string together the cataclysmic events where the visual awe can resume. This is very much like how video games are currently constructed.</p>
<p>Even with many of the technological barriers and limitations of early consoles eliminated, games remain a very difficult engineering challenge. Historically, the people responsible for creating games have been reliant on simplistic narratives to lend their game some form of meaning and motivation beyond numbers. This trend continues today because developers are not writers — nor should they be. It’s hard enough to make a game that’s fun, looks good, runs well, and meets deadlines. Telling a meaningful story or developing characters at all has been a luxury.</p>
<p>But for games to evolve, this needs to change. Part of that means addressing how video games are designed, but there is a cultural issue to deal with first.</p>
<p><strong>#gamergate must be dissolved</strong></p>
<p>If you’re unfamiliar with #gamergate, here are two decent mainstream summaries. There can be no meaningful discussion about progressing video game culture until this miserable shitstorm is over. It is part of my impetus for writing this article.</p>
<p>When it first began, I figured it was just a flash in the pan, the momentary lashing out of the internet’s moodier denizens as I’ve seen happen over and over again. But as it continues to exist and its participants seem no less dissuaded in the righteous nature of their cause as they harass and abuse important members of the online community, I have come to see #gamergate as the stubborn tantrum of a (very malevolent) child that fails to see the larger picture.</p>
<p>Some of #gamergate’s participants maintain that it’s about ethics in journalism. And there’s a part of me that sympathizes with the hatred for Gawker. I stopped reading Gawker years ago, specifically after they released the identity of the Apple employee that lost the iPhone prototype. I saw an organization hell-bent on collecting the clicks wherever possible, and no longer felt comfortable supporting an organization whose ethics were so clearly missing.</p>
<p>But I feel gross even musing with the idea that #gamergate is really about ethics at all. Why is Sarkeesian the target of such hate when her videos are so dispassionate and thoroughly researched — is this not an outstanding model for ethical journalism? Why should Felicia Day be doxed for a reasonable and fair contribution on the topic? There simply is no justification. It’s a cultural turf war, the expression of child-minded individuals who cannot handle the suggestion that video games can and should be something different than what we’ve seen so far.</p>
<p>Games are not just for straight men. They’re for women and LGBTs. They’re for children as well as adults. They’re for black and hispanic Americans. They’re for the Peruvians and Brazilians, Chinese, Vietnamese, South Africans, Australians, Italians, and Egyptians. They’re for every community you can imagine. To stay relevant, games must adapt to reflect this diversity of human experience. The gaming community needs to rally against #gamergate and demonstrate that video game culture will not be controlled by a misanthropic and small-minded hate group. At this point, I genuinely believe that if #gamergate goes on much longer, (more) permanent damage will be done to the future of video games as brilliant, creative, and brave women are chased out of the industry.</p>
<p>Depending on the longevity of the movement I may write more about the nature of #gamergate in the future, but for now, I think it’s just important to motivate action by people outside the group.</p>
<p><strong>Advancing game design</strong></p>
<p>The important thing to understand about video games is their variety. By their very nature, not all games can tell a coherent story at all. Some games are completely abstract explorations of color and shape without any definable characters. Others are too absurd and bizarre in real-world terms to merit narrative depth. There’s very few generalizations that can be made about video games as a whole.</p>
<p>For example, what possible plot can you give to Mario? No one wants Mario to speak, nor should Nintendo add cutscenes between levels. Bowser is not a villain that needs explaining. He’s just evil. No explanation required. Go jump on some goombas. The game is good as it is. As it happens, the damsel in distress is actually a reasonably appropriate shtick for the game, because there’s not much else you can do within that space outside of adding an option to play as a female. But that’s actually an important first step.</p>
<p><strong>1: Strive for equal representation of men and women as the protagonist, enemies, NPCs, and supporting characters.</strong></p>
<p>This is something that all games can do. There’s just no reason not to. It’s a simple way to acknowledge that players might not be male. It creates a more accurate representation of the real world, where men and women are present in equal quantities.</p>
<p><strong>2: Avoid stereotyping based on gender or ethnicity</strong></p>
<p>It feels almost unfair to criticize games for this when movies regularly fail to do this, but I don’t see that as an excuse to hold video games to a lower standard. Moreover, games tend to engage in stereotyping to a far more extreme extent. In the real world, most women do not feel pink is their favorite color, nor do they keep ribbons in their hair at all times, nor do they consider flowers a fundamental representation of their identity. Most women do not have a sleek, athletic build with large (but not too large) breasts and a huge butt. Most women do not live solely for the existence of their husbands and children, but lead rich, fulfilling, independent lives. So when are games going to include female characters that represent this reality? We’re doing it for men, so it’s clearly not a limitation of designer creativity.</p>
<p>I haven’t touched much on ethnic diversity in this article, but it’s important to point out that many of the same problems are present when you consider racial representation in video games. There are very few black, hispanic, or asian protagonists, and supporting characters tend to be little more than crude caricatures of stereotypes. Again, movies are equally guilty in this department, but games have less of an excuse — these are worlds where the only limit is our imagination. Why are we only imagining straight, white males?</p>
<p>As a final note, I was tempted to say that all stereotyping should be avoided — but as in Mario, I believe that simple tropes and stereotypes have utility for games where human relationships and stories aren’t really relevant or useful. Games should just avoid cliches that carry normative implications.</p>
<p><strong>3: Imagine worlds truly different than our own</strong></p>
<p>At times, the sexism we see in video games is far more than an indication of the attitudes of the creators, but a representation of broader cultural issues. Some games actively strive to emulate the fallen nature of humanity, in all its bigotry and hate. That’s good. We need games that do that, even if they’re dark and offensive. But even more, we need games that show us how different things could be. We cherish books, movies, and music for giving us glimpses into alternate realities where society is not bound by archaic and regressive attitudes. Where are the games that allow us to experience a different kind of human world?</p>
<p>We have games that take us into space, into ancient history, into alternate universes, where swords and sorcery are commonplace, where dragons and super-intelligent AI rule the lands, where aliens of all shapes, sizes, and colors exist. Why are we so incapable of seeing our own world as being a little bit different? Where women are not helpless and boring, but unique, powerful, and interesting? Where the color of skin is irrelevant, or means something completely different than what we know?</p>
<p>It is not a limitation of our imagination. Incredible sci-fi and fantasy worlds have been crafted with exquisite creativity and detail. It is time to use that same power to imagine the world we know as the place it ought to be.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>A brief comment on the resignation of Mozilla CEO, Brendan Eich. &nbsp;In particular, the contents of the <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/04/after-eich-firing-conservatives-slam-mozilla-and-call-for-boycott/#p3" target="_blank">quite viral article from Ars Technica</a> are what inspire me to write. &nbsp;I have one point to make, and it’s a simple one.</p>
<p>Let’s do some phrase replacement with the quotes from the article.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Calls for his ouster were premised on the notion that all [opposition to the Civil Rights Act] was hateful, and that a CEO should be judged not just by his or her conduct in the professional realm, but also by [racial or ethnic biases] he or she supports as a private citizen.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Here’s another.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>But at a time when we are demanding passage of the [Civil Rights Act] so that companies can’t just up and fire [minority] employees because they <strong>don’t agree with them</strong> — as they can now in about two-thirds of our states — we need to think very long and hard about whether we should demand someone be removed from his job for exercising his constitutional rights as part of the cornerstone of our democracy: a free and fair election.</em></p>
<p><em>We say that [minorities] shouldn’t be fired for something that has nothing to do with their job performance. I think that principle is good enough to apply to everyone, including Eich. And there is no evidence that I can find that his [opposition to the Civil Rights Act] affected his ability to do the job he was hired to do. Eich [opposes the Civil Rights Act]&nbsp;out of his own pocket. He didn’t [oppose the Civil Rights Act]&nbsp;on behalf of Mozilla, he didn’t [oppose the Civil Rights Act]&nbsp;with Mozilla funds or through a foundation sponsored by Mozilla. And he certainly didn’t own Mozilla, which is a non-profit organization. It was his own dime on his own time.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Emphasis is mine. &nbsp;One more.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Pardon this interruption of your TruthRevolt experience. Mozilla recently forced its CEO, Brendan Eich, to resign over his personal support for [racial segregation]. The firing followed a vicious smear campaign against Eich by dating website OKCupid, in which OKCupid blocked Mozilla users from visiting their website.</em></p>
<p><em>We would therefore prefer that our users not use Mozilla software to access TruthRevolt, given Mozilla’s crackdown on [racial or ethnic biases] held by millions of Americans.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Realistically, opposition to same-sex marriage is not quite the same as supporting racial segregation, but the point stands. &nbsp;These views&nbsp;are anathema, and for good reason. &nbsp;Racism, sexism, and homophobia are not run-of-the-mill political stances in the vein of educational reform or progressive taxation. &nbsp;They are a fundamental disrespect towards fellow human beings and should be treated as such.</p>
<p>In America, we allow anyone to be as racist as they please, but we hold public figures to a higher standard than others. &nbsp;CEOs are not 9-to-5 laborers that get to leave work at the office. &nbsp;They represent and embody their organizations around the clock. &nbsp;The CEO’s merits and flaws reflect upon the company as a whole, including the people who work for them. &nbsp;Because of this, it matters a great deal how the highest-paid person in any company chooses to spend their money and their time. &nbsp;Just&nbsp;imagine how it would feel as an employee at Mozilla to have your paychecks signed by a man actively seeking to prevent or dissolve your marriage. &nbsp;That’s not just a difference of opinion.</p>

    <p><em><strong><a tabindex="1" href="http://www.reddit.com/r/electronicmusic/comments/1yyb3m/is_it_dumb_to_love_a_label_and_its_culture/" target="_blank">Is it dumb to love a label and its culture?</a></strong></em><em></em></p>
<p><em>I’m just a huge fan of Mad Decent and its culture. Just really different and always tries something new. I feel like I like it and the idea of it, too much.</em></p>
<p><em>Do you feel me?</em></p>
<p>—</p>
<p>It’s a good question, one that is ripe for discussion.</p>
<p>One of my favorite labels is&nbsp;<a href="http://www.kitsune.fr/journal/labelsartists/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kitsuné</a>&nbsp;– I enjoy the vast majority of the artists they sign, and it’s no coincidence that they also happen to make&nbsp;<a href="http://shop.kitsune.fr/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">clothing</a>. They recognize that their listeners have a certain style they can tap into. The cynical perspective is to say they’re manipulating sheep into buying a lifestyle, but the fact of the matter is that music correlates to more than just what we listen to, much the same as any other serious passion in life.</p>
<p>One of the things I’ve come to love about electronica as a whole is that it has developed so many flavors and niches to accommodate the diversity of its listeners. It isn’t just about trance, techno, and house any more. Each new subgenre isn’t just the product of some marketing shill desperately trying to differentiate a new artist. It is rare that I ever encounter Dutch house that I enjoy, but I can never get enough of French house. Some days I want epic trance, but others only psy trance will suffice.</p>
<p>Personally, I listen to electronica because it makes me feel a certain way – it fuels my imagination in specific ways that I want. The aesthetic and mystique of a song or an artist are every bit a part of that. Tracks do not exist in a vacuum – they have names, they frequently come packaged in albums, they’re delivered in concerts and music videos. The execution of this whole package is frequently beyond the talent of an individual artist, and comes down to the label to fill in the blanks. Some labels fail miserably at this, and it is the quintessential flaw of the major labels; they frequently homogenize and crush the individuality of their artists. The great labels bring together artists into something that is greater than the sum of their parts.</p>
<p>There is absolutely no shame in loving a label. For many artists, they provide aesthetics through designers, structure through management, polish through producers, and exposure through marketing. To hate any of these things is ignorant of the challenges of commercial viability. I, for one, am grateful that I don’t have to loathe the labels my favorite artists are signed to. I can readily see the ways many labels in EDM are advancing the industry, and that is a beautiful thing.</p>

    <p><em>For posterity, I preserve here my summary of why the individual mandate (perhaps the most contentious feature of the Affordable Care Act) is not a slap in the face to Liberty or Freedom. &nbsp;This was the inciting fartbook comment. &nbsp;Oh, and yes, I’m on that shit again. &nbsp;Whatever.</em></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Forcing people to purchase anything, is an encroachment on liberty</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>BLOOPADOOP (&lt;— <em>REDACTED LOL</em>), that stance is non-viable in this context. It’s comparable to answering “Yes” when the question is “Red or white?”.<br data-reactid=".r[5367f].[1][4][1]{comment982624400698_3743000}.[0].{right}.[0].{left}.[0].[0].[0][3].[0].[4]"><br data-reactid=".r[5367f].[1][4][1]{comment982624400698_3743000}.[0].{right}.[0].{left}.[0].[0].[0][3].[0].[5]">The individual mandate is not some socialist conspiracy, nor does it have any relation to personal or social freedom. Every modern country implements some version of the individual mandate because at some point every citizen is going to use the health care system. Unless you’re going to argue that hospitals should reject life-saving treatment at the ER because they cannot immediately determine the financial or insurance status of a patient, then those people need to have insurance if health-care providers want to have any hope of receiving compensation for the treatment they provide.<br data-reactid=".r[5367f].[1][4][1]{comment982624400698_3743000}.[0].{right}.[0].{left}.[0].[0].[0][3].[0].[7]"><br data-reactid=".r[5367f].[1][4][1]{comment982624400698_3743000}.[0].{right}.[0].{left}.[0].[0].[0][3].[0].[8]">The individual mandate solves several problems. One, it prevents people from signing up for insurance right when they get sick. Insurance companies were able to reject people with pre-existing conditions because of this – which is ridiculous in its own right. Like other forms of insurance, health insurance is only financially viable if individuals are paying into it over the long-term.<br data-reactid=".r[5367f].[1][4][1]{comment982624400698_3743000}.[0].{right}.[0].{left}.[0].[0].[0][3].[0].[10]"><br data-reactid=".r[5367f].[1][4][1]{comment982624400698_3743000}.[0].{right}.[0].{left}.[0].[0].[0][3].[0].[11]">Two, it guarantees basic services. Currently, ERs are inundated with patients that do not have insurance. Consider a very common scenario, especially among the economically disadvantaged: someone with diabetes enters diabetic shock and is rushed to the ER. Treatment at the ER is more expensive by a factor of 10 or more, and there is no guarantee that the diabetic won’t return to the ER next week. Worse still, this patient does not have insurance and has no chance of paying even a fraction of the $2k+ bill (and that’s a moderate estimate) that was racked up with each visit.<br data-reactid=".r[5367f].[1][4][1]{comment982624400698_3743000}.[0].{right}.[0].{left}.[0].[0].[0][3].[0].[13]"><br data-reactid=".r[5367f].[1][4][1]{comment982624400698_3743000}.[0].{right}.[0].{left}.[0].[0].[0][3].[0].[14]">Which brings us to three: lower costs for health care. Preventative care is drastically cheaper here – regular visits with a primary care physician, testing supplies, insulin – all of which are easily available and covered partially or fully by almost any insurance plan. Everyone in the system benefits by this person having insurance – the hospital isn’t providing services for free which means it doesn’t have to charge other patients more to make up for the loss, plus the patient is healthier (uses services less frequently) and their personal burden of hospital bills is greatly lessened.<br data-reactid=".r[5367f].[1][4][1]{comment982624400698_3743000}.[0].{right}.[0].{left}.[0].[0].[0][3].[0].[16]"><br data-reactid=".r[5367f].[1][4][1]{comment982624400698_3743000}.[0].{right}.[0].{left}.[0].[0].[0][3].[0].[17]">I understand that you don’t want to pay for other people’s health care. The reality is, however, that you already are – check out what your insurance company paid for your last visit, or maybe you notice your premiums keep going up while no extra service is being provided. The individual mandate is a recognition of the simple fact that everyone must take responsibility for their past, current, and future use of our health care systems.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>As a teenager, <em>24</em> was one of the first television shows to really draw me in. I’ve been revisiting it, and it’s spurred a lot of thoughts about how television has evolved and why the show held such wide appeal during its run. &nbsp;It was an intense and tightly edited series. It told multiple stories in parallel, the drama was generally compelling, and the main character was an uncompromising badass. Kiefer Sutherland really knows how to look good running around with a drawn pistol. Now that I’m a bit older and wiser, the show seems almost crass in the simplicity of its dialogue, character construction, plotline, and the absurd quantity of cultural and gender stereotyping that fuels the conflicts and interactions across the show. &nbsp;But it’s an interesting case study in how network television channels managed to escape the mire of episodic sitcoms that dominated the 90’s.</p>
<figure id="attachment_2535" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://thelackthereof.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/jack-bauer.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2535" alt="This is what Jack Bauer looks like at most points during the show." src="./index_files/jack-bauer-300x239.jpg" width="300" height="239"></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Jack Bauer is not exactly a complex character.</figcaption></figure>
<p>In <em>24</em>, characters frequently behave in ways that are clearly motivated by the writers’ need to create drama and increase tension, lest the show drift into that most dangerous territory of the mundane. The writers are frequently shameless in how they generate character interactions, making heavy use of techno-babble simply to provide an excuse for characters to walk from one desk to another. What these characters actually do at their jobs is hilariously difficult to define. With all their talk of protocols, encryptions, and sockets, you might imagine that they’re in IT, but at no other point do these characters profess any expertise in the realm of technology or computers.</p>
<p>The writers skirt around this problem by placing focus on each character’s socio-emotional struggles and most importantly, on the consequences of failure or success. It doesn’t matter how the file was corrupted, what matters is that there’s a mole working against the good guys. It doesn’t matter what encryption socket (this is a term they actually use) the super-nerd transmogrified, it only matters that if they can’t get past it the bomb is going to go off.</p>
<p>This exclusive focus on outcomes is the defining feature of the writing in this show, and it allowed the writers to improvise as much as necessary. The real-time premise of <em>24</em> makes it very easy to gloss over the basic details for any given character. When a new character is inserted, there’s rarely a need to provide any introduction. Their dialogue is exclusively purposed towards the current storyline, and any tertiary details are unnecessary until the writers want the audience to become attached to the character. Characters can sometimes go multiple episodes without the audience having any specific notion of a character’s values, traits, personality, or background.</p>
<p>If the audience is caught up in the flow of the show, none of that will be noticed. If you never mention whether or not Kim has a boyfriend until 5 episodes in, there’s no problem with having her suddenly call this hitherto unmentioned boyfriend for help once she’s out of options. By being non-specific about the nature of any character’s background, writers are able to create a solution to their storyline problems on the spot without overtly compromising the trust of the audience. Glaring plot holes alienate dedicated viewers because the real joys of complex dramas are that they create fodder for viewers to chew on.</p>
<p>Take <em>LOST</em>, for example. The comparison here is surprisingly apt; both shows have a broad cast of characters that contribute to simultaneous plotlines and parallel storytelling. Featuring perhaps the most disastrous wrap-up of any modern television series, many people that loved <em>LOST</em> while it aired will have a hard time reflecting positively on it now. Re-watching the show is nothing less than torturous when you know how futile most of the storyline really is. While it was airing, however, it was an absolute delight to ponder the possible answers to all of the questions that the show posed. Many hours could be spent debating the various merits and flaws of the characters. I could still write essays on how much I disliked Kate.</p>
<figure id="attachment_2533" style="width: 291px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="./index_files/lost-finale-jack.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2533" alt="lost-finale-jack" src="./index_files/lost-finale-jack.jpg" width="291" height="212"></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Clearly, <em>“We have to go back, Kate”</em> was a direct plea of agony from the writers.</figcaption></figure>
<p>The writers for <em>LOST</em> trapped themselves into a corner that, after 6 seasons, they simply couldn’t write their way out of. Part of the show’s initial lure were the countless mysteries the show offered up in just the first season. The polar bear, the smoke monster, the hatch, the Others, the French radio loop. Although they were able to navigate some of these points in respectable form, they had simply dug themselves too deep by the end of the show. It ends with a great, big “They were dead all along”. &nbsp;Thirty minutes of floppy dicks would likely have been a less insulting way to end the show.</p>
<p>While I hesitate to praise any of the writing in <em>24</em>, it’s intelligent in how they pace feeding information to the viewer. Normally, this would make for a terribly dull experience. &nbsp;But that’s where <em>24</em>‘s editing and production comes into play. One of <em>24</em>‘s hallmarks was the split-screen shots used during sequence intros/outros and scene transitions. &nbsp;While far from the first show to make use of this effect, it’s a critical component to its ability to tell multiple stories in a way that most viewers can follow along with. &nbsp;Constant reminders are invaluable for helping the audience keep pace. &nbsp;Which is funny, given that the stories themselves are not that deep.</p>
<figure id="attachment_2532" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://thelackthereof.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/24.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2532" alt="24" src="./index_files/24-300x168.jpg" width="300" height="168"></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Kiefer Sutherland’s audition for <em>24</em> required that he stare menacingly at the casting director for three days straight.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Examined apart from the rest of the story, each character is relatively simple and their conflicts are straightforward. &nbsp;Appropriate camerawork and great editing saves the day here. &nbsp;An inordinate amount of time is spent focused on facial expressions. &nbsp;There’s no time for thorough dialogue, monologues, or deep conversations in a real-time show. &nbsp;Facial expressions will have to do, and the hand-held camera helps drive home the sloppy, relentless nature of the events in the show. &nbsp;The editors also rely heavily on silence and hesitation to insert doubt and suspicion into the audience’s mind. &nbsp;The show is rife with betrayal and backstabbing, and with nothing but a second or two of a glare following a heated exchange, or an awkward pause in the middle of a discussion, the audience is pulled to attention, forced to question the truth of what they’ve just heard or what they’re about to hear. &nbsp;These techniques are used frequently throughout the show, often just as red herrings, or just to lead into minor plot points.</p>
<p>Anticipation is a major factor, too. &nbsp;The dialogue frequently reinforces upcoming events at specific times, and the ticking clock makes certain viewers won’t forget that the bomb is going to explode in an hour, that if the suspect doesn’t yield to torture soon enough they won’t get there in time, that if the agents don’t find the file they won’t have the code to disarm the bomb. &nbsp;Individually, these are simplistic narratives, but told in tandem it creates a stressful and addictive experience for the viewer.</p>
<p>It’s unfortunate that some of its qualities are so regrettable; there’s an overwhelming stench of sexism throughout the show, with almost every female character being a damsel in distress or seductress in one form or another. &nbsp;The cultural stereotypes also demand mentioning, as there’s relentless bald-faced stereotyping of Arabic, Eastern European, and Asian cultures, especially as it comes to politics and terrorism. &nbsp;Lastly, the show is a true icon of its time, with the immense abuse of terrorism as a focal point, and I can only imagine how much it fueled the imaginations of fearful Americans across the country after 9/11. &nbsp;I have no doubt that many people’s views on the morality of torture were molded by watching Jack Bauer foil countless terrorist plots with his creative torture techniques.</p>
<p>While it hasn’t aged particularly well, it’s fun to look back at&nbsp;<em>24</em> and see the components of its production that made it so compelling to watch and how these mesh with its failures. &nbsp;The elements that make it weak are endemic across myriad movies and television shows, but it’s a hell of a lot better than much of what came before it. &nbsp;It&nbsp;demonstrates the viability of yet another crutch to smooth over poorly-conceived plots, characters, and dialogue, but its strengths are indicative of the progress that mainstream storytelling has made over the years, allowing for a great variety of characters with deeper stories. &nbsp;I’d say that’s not so bad.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>After 8 years on Facebook, I deactivated my account this weekend for the first time. I can’t quite say it’s the last time, as it’s turned out that third-party applications are able to reactivate your account (I’m glaring at you, Spotify) – but the idea is to be done with Facebook for all personal matters. It’s still a necessary broadcast node, so I’ve converted to a <a href="http://facebook.com/thunderfunking">fan page</a>, but it’s nonetheless on its way out as a core website in my internet experience.</p>
<p>Facebook, for better or worse, has married itself to the newsfeed style of presentation. Content is consumed through a single, linear feed, prioritized arbitrarily by volume of comments and likes. While this makes Facebook easy to browse and requires very little commitment on the part of the user, comments and likes are a terribly shallow means of interaction; comments auto-submit when users press enter, and likes are a generic catch-all, encompassing all types of possible meaning: “I support this”, “This is funny”, “This is interesting”, “I noticed this”, “Good for you”, and most obviously “I like this”. Combined with the aforementioned use of likes as a measure of approval or quality, the phraseology of likes inherently leads to massive biases in the type of content that ends up most frequently posted and becomes most visible. &nbsp;Because likes determine visibility and most content has a relatively short window of opportunity to be viewed by your network, there’s a snowball effect that strongly favors content that does not require users to leave the site.</p>
<p>This has lead to a complete dominance of the image format, which I believe has resulted in a commoditization of many of the most important moments of life. &nbsp;Weddings, babies, graduations, parties, vacations, and the ubiquitous shots of prepared food are far and away the most prevalent content, easily garnering maximum approval regardless of the demographics in question. &nbsp;I’ve <a href="http://thelackthereof.com/wp/2012/08/20/nomenclad/">talked before</a> of the filter that this creates, where Facebook becomes a repository for nothing but the most positive and trivial features of our daily lives. &nbsp;There is no mention of or place for complication, and no meaningful means of support or compassion for darkness or tragedy. &nbsp;If you have something difficult going on in your life that is more complex than one-liners about the weather, traffic, or Obama, you can expect little help from Facebook. &nbsp;Moreover, Facebook encourages comparisons between people, and through its prioritization of most-liked content, is bound to leave users that have nothing exciting to share about their lives feeling poor and less-than.</p>
<p>I speak of this, of course, from experience. &nbsp;As my own life has spiraled into an ever-deepening maw of absurd twists and turns that have found me trotting around the country and pinching pennies as best I can, every visit to Facebook has left me feeling dissatisfied with my status in life. &nbsp;It’s all too easy to hop on and see professional photo shoots of newly engaged couples sharing intense gazes of pure love, parents posting shots of children captured at moments with bright smiles and laughter, students in graduation gowns elated to be done with school. &nbsp;I can rationalize and remind myself that this is not the full story and that I ought to be grateful to have a job, a place to live, and food to eat – but this is not how the brain functions. &nbsp;Humans are hard-wired to actively <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_neuron">experience the contents of every photograph</a> we witness. As users of Facebook become savvier with the timing and framing of their shots while Instagram steps in to coat everything in retro-noir artgasms, it’s impossible not to feel like one is missing out on Life Which Is Happening Right Now.</p>
<p>It is a another form of the Rat Race, and rather than try to contort my life to fit within the format that Facebook desires, I have concluded that it is time for me to move on. &nbsp;It’s about time, anyways. &nbsp;Being on Facebook since my sophomore year of high school presents problems for which there are no solutions. &nbsp;What do you do with the friends from high school that you like, but you haven’t talked to in 5 years and know you’ll never see again? &nbsp;What do you do with the pictures of old girlfriends? &nbsp;Most of all, how can I feel confident entering the next phase of my life carrying all of this baggage? &nbsp;I see no viable solution other than a clean slate with a more one-way type of interaction. &nbsp;While I’ll be remiss to lose touch with many acquaintances, I don’t believe Facebook was offering much utility to my daily life anyways.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>This last year I’ve had the fortune to visit the Museum of Modern Art, and this last month, the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art here in Kansas City.</p>
<p>The experience of visiting a museum is not unlike visiting a zoo. While zoos carry the bonus moral quandary associated with the efforts to acquire large varieties of exotic animals for the purpose of bolstering attendance, in America we’ve mostly done away with the archaic model of placing animals in metal cages for crude exhibition. Modern zoos tend to place much more focus on accomodating the needs of the animals by replicating their natural environments. As a result, many zoos are now an active part of global efforts to understand and protect endangered species.</p>
<p>Similarly, museums offer the opportunity to do more than just celebrate beautiful or interesting objects and their creators, but can become a part of a larger effort to properly understand history in all of its enormous complexity. One of the features I enjoyed most about the Nelson-Atkins Museum was that it was just as much about history as it was art. Paintings and sculptures were surrounded by relevant architechture, furniture, pottery, clothing, weapons, and armor, providing context and a little bit of immersion into the culture and time from which they came. While it’s unfair to compare museums when they have such decidedly different goals and purposes, there is much value and importance to the way in which art is experienced and appreciated. Nothing is created in a vaccuum, and most of these artists didn’t spend hundreds of hours crafting a piece just for it to occupy a closet, let alone a museum. Most art is made to live inside a specific time and a precise location.</p>
<p>This was one of the things that bothered me about the MOMA – so much emphasis was placed on how creations are justified. Predictably, this was most prevalent in the post-modern exhibits, which are accompanied by paragraphs of text explaining the inspiration, symbolism, and intent of each piece. There’s certainly value in the meta-analysis that these pieces embody, but I have a difficult time in respecting their inaccessibility and obscurity. It’s art for artists, rather than art that society can tangibly benefit from.</p>
<p>One downside of museums, historically, is that when something gets placed on a pedastel to be viewed publicly, there’s a natural tendency for other artists to crave the fame they see these pieces acquiring. It encourages the desire for artists to impress other artists, resulting in sometimes laughably irrelevant inside jokes and obscure references. &nbsp;However, by emphasizing context and relationship to society rather than singular artists or creations, a museum can becomes less about celebrating the genius of an individual, and more about the genius of a culture.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>A few weeks ago there was a NYT article titled&nbsp;<a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/17/how-to-live-without-irony/?pagewanted=print">“How to Live Without Irony”</a> that seemed to touch a nerve with a variety of people. It was about hipsters and how to solve the problem that they represent. I did not approve.</p>
<p>I’ve been called a hipster a number of times, usually because I used the word “obscure” to describe one of my hobbies – but I don’t have many of the qualities the article describes. The problem is that everyone means something different when they talk about hipsters. Is the hipster defined by lifestyle? Fashion choices? Personality, or philosophy? The article sought to define it as a dedication to irony and an insincere attitude, but this doesn’t compute for me. No one wakes up one day, puts on a fedora and decides that what is good in life is to be fake and pretentious. Instead, I believe hipster is stereotype that applies to a certain demographic – artistically-minded young adults living in urban settings. If this is the case, I think the article becomes a bit more ridiculous.</p>
<p>Imagine if someone were to write a similar article about rednecks. It might seem an unfair comparison at first, but redneck is another derogatory stereotype used to describe a specific demographic. There are fashion choices, like NASCAR shirts and NRA hats. There is a philosophy and political perspective, most often anti-government in nature, sometimes religiously motivated, but not always. There is a lifestyle that might involve living in rural areas, driving lifted pick-up trucks, and devoting time to gun collection or hunting. These are all generalizations, but it’s not difficult to find groups of people with many of these qualities.</p>
<p>Yet, even as redneck is considered a negative descriptor, we accept it as a reality of how and where people grow up. You would never see an article in the NYT instructing rednecks how to live without a love for shooting wild animals. There are essays on the inherent value of wildlife and articles proposing stronger gun control, but they aren’t telling an entire demographic that the way they live is inferior or fundamentally wrong. If there were such an article, the response would be simple: you don’t get it.</p>
<p>What the author fails to understand is that even if hipsters grossly overuse irony, this doesn’t equate to a lack of sincerity, and it certainly doesn’t mean that an entire generation has lost the ability to be genuine. There’s a name for people who fake their identities: posers. Posers exist in every demographic, and they’re hardly unique to the 21st century. Not to be glib, but the irony of this article is that it tries to identify posers by the way they dress and talk. &nbsp;It’s these very generalizations that have encouraged hipsters to develop their anti-styles and parodies of the rest of society.</p>
<p>The only way to identify the people who are truly fake is by seeking to know them – not by looking at their shoes, glasses, hair, or speech. &nbsp;It is the same with anyone. &nbsp;There are many false politicians, but there are genuine politicians as well, and it is not their words or their dress that divides them. &nbsp;There are fake punks, fake goths, and fake Juggalos, but the phonies do not dictate the merit of a lifestyle. &nbsp;Until we learn to recognize individuals as individuals, posers will continue to flourish throughout all sectors of society.</p>

    <p>I generally try to avoid jumping on media bandwagons when picking topics to explore, here, but I’ve seen one too many glib quotes from people who want to explain the world as having one big problem that just so happens to coincide with their worldview. I get as choked up as anyone else reading about the Sandy Hook shooting, but there’s some hard facts that demand recognition.</p>
<p><strong>This is going to happen again. And again. And again. No matter what.</strong></p>
<p>The only factors we can control are the frequency and the severity. &nbsp;I’m entirely on board with much stronger gun control – but we’re kidding ourselves if we think it was a lack of legislation that allowed this event to happen. Broad legislation is not effective in dealing with lone individuals that aren’t a part of any organization or group. It’s the same with drugs; prosecuting users is a waste of time, and that’s why the focus of law enforcement agencies is on producers and distributors. The goal is to reduce availability and increase the cost of acquisition to the point that it’s no longer desirable or feasible, particularly at larger scales.</p>
<p>We don’t live in a world where it’s possible to eliminate access to anything. If a guy wants to buy an assault rifle or some heroin, there are myriad ways to do it, whether it’s through making the right friends, going outside of the country, or through the internet. We haven’t even reached the true age of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darknet_(file_sharing)">darknets</a> – but I’ve already heard a number of tales from different people that systems like the Silk Road are quite real and very efficient. The guy in this case didn’t even use clandestine means to acquire his weapons, but there’s no reason to doubt that he would have gone to great lengths to get what he wanted to achieve his goals. &nbsp;This isn’t even touching on 3D printing of guns and ammunition.</p>
<p>Yes, there is an argument to be made that such ease of access reduces the required threshold of effort – but I guarantee you that an individual like Lanza is not married to guns as the only means of violence. The easiest and most relevant example here is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Kehoe">Andrew Kehoe</a>, who exclusively used bombs. The Columbine shooters also made bombs – they just didn’t use them. If we’re talking about an individual that’s willing to kill children, we’re talking about an individual that is not reasonable and almost certainly not mentally stable. That’s why this is going to happen again.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-connecticut-shooting-samuel-jackson-gun-control-20121216,0,2690925.story">Samuel L. Jackson quote</a> that’s been going around is nothing short of absurd. Society didn’t fail to teach Lanza the value of life – no one has to be taught that mass murder is wrong because our own sense of empathy will almost always kick in and tell us we’re thinking something pretty screwed up. That’s because empathy is innate, but there are people who come with more of it and people who come with less of it – or even none of it. Lanza was diagnosed with Asperger’s, and one of the key features of the autistic spectrum is an inability to empathize with other human beings. If you want to know how another human being could point an assault rifle at a 6 year-old and pull the trigger, the answer is the same as how you can go to a shooting range and shoot wooden pallets. People without the ability to empathize do not see humans as being particularly different from anything else in the environment, which is why a lack of eye contact in infancy is a strong predictor of autism.</p>
<p>It frustrates me to no end when people throw up their hands and say “How could this happen?” as if this were the first time, as if this time were fundamentally different from the previous incidents. We’ve been dealing with entirely unwarranted massacres of innocent adults and children for all of human history, and explaining this as being some indicator of a change in values within American society is nothing but a red herring to try and advance an agenda. Similarly, as much as I agree with the need for stronger gun control legislation, I don’t think it’s the most relevant precipitating factor here.</p>
<p>Until we, as a global society, develop reliable and efficient methods for recognizing critical differences in mental function, somewhere around .1% of our population is going to present a high degree of risk to the rest of us. Morality doesn’t change the nature of psychosis, and stronger legislation is unlikely to stop a single psychotic individual from subverting the law. More reliable diagnosis and more effective treatment for psychological disorders is the best prevention we can hope for.</p>

    <p>If I said that I’ve had enough controversy in the last year to last for the remainder of my life, it would be an understatement and a lie. At this point, I’ve come to accept that for whatever reason, my actions frequently generate drama at a rate that greatly surpasses the national average. I don’t see myself as a dramatic person, but my personality, values, choices, preferences, and circumstances seem to combine with one another in such a way that results in situations where emotions run high, sides are formed, and battles ensue.</p>
<p>This blog has been the platform for more minor battles in the past. This time, however, the myriad details of the catalogue of nonsense that my life has become are not suitable for a blog post. As much as I would love the convenience of updating everyone on all the specifics in one place, there are too many friends I prefer to hold on to, or in some cases, keep a minimum of respect intact. It’s not just about pissing people off, either, but about respecting the privacy of others. No one should have to force me to sign an NDA before being honest with me.</p>
<p>There’s also the problem of objectivity. It’s easy to remain fair when describing simpler situations, but as more players are added to the game, it becomes much more difficult to give appropriate consideration to all relevant perspectives. Sports fans have argued passionately for weeks over who was to blame for the outcome of a single game and yet never reach a definitive conclusion; there is no reason to believe I would have any more success in trying to analyze this debacle. The best I can do is describe a few of the precipitating factors and then provide some illumination on my current course of action.</p>
<p>Thirteen years is a long time to be in a town like Ithaca. I’ve wanted to get away for a long time, but my attempts have been hampered by attachment, procrastination, and misery. On the whole, I’d say it was a good thing that most of my wishes did not come true, as I had a lot to learn about life that would have taken much longer had I never made the friends that I did. In particular, the two years I spent living near downtown were nothing less than exquisite, and I racked up experiences and stories that helped greatly in accelerating the formation of my identity.</p>
<p>After that, however, I decided to move back in with my parents to help afford school. Well-intentioned though it may have been, this was not a wise decision. For the first six months, it was merely a frustrating circumstance. When my partner found out she was pregnant, however, this transformed into a catastrophic situation. &nbsp;I was already displeased at the length of my stay in Ithaca, but the toxicity of the situation cemented my resolve to get out. There are people who have said and continue to say that I am running away, that I am abandoning my child-to-be. This is false. I am doing what’s best for everyone: removing myself from a pernicious state of affairs in order to ensure that my son will have a father that will be able to share a love of life with him, rather than bitterness, despair, and rage. At no point in this sequence of events have I had the luxury of privacy, let alone control; the only variable I have power over now is myself. &nbsp;I am securing my son’s future by guaranteeing I will not allow circumstances to determine what kind of father I am.</p>
<p>The last point I’d like to make is that there has seemed to be a specific notion from many people about how best to raise a child. This notion is overwhelmingly just an exact copy of what they had growing up. A true and loving family can exist in a huge variety of configurations, but many people insist that the specific features of how they were raised are utterly essential. These values persist despite recognizing major flaws in their development, or even describing total misery throughout youth. If I want to improve on the formula that my own parents deployed, I have to be ready to try things in a different way, and willing to do whatever it takes to excise as many of my own flaws from stunting the emotional and intellectual development of my child. &nbsp;If you still disagree with my choices, that is fine. There is no one in the world but me who has all of the information necessary to make these choices, so I cannot blame anyone for failing to understand.</p>
<p>So, I currently find myself in Kansas City, Missouri. &nbsp;The original plan was for Durham, North Carolina, but that whole thing fell through at the last minute. &nbsp;I had to improvise, which meant writing many emails and making phone calls to a lot of my internet and SK friends. &nbsp;The last week and a half has been rather nutty; I’ve been trying to keep notes, but the pace of life is currently much greater than the speed of my writing. &nbsp;There’s a lot of keeping up to do.</p>
<p>Note: I had to disable commenting before I left Ithaca. &nbsp;I still haven’t found an anti-spam plugin that I’m satisfied with and moderating comments is too much to try to do from this tablet. &nbsp;Feel free to send comments via email or on Facebook/Google+.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>I was going to do an election post, but like everyone else, I’m pretty sick of the election. I just can’t finish it. Instead, I’ll post a conversation with a friend that discusses a lot of the topics I wanted to cover anyways.</p>
<p><em><strong>Laïka</strong></em>: supposing a two-party system, voting blocks will ultimately/inevitably split up almost evenly<br>
<em><strong>Laïka</strong></em>: ie, that it’s really no coincidence that our elections always seem almost even<br>
<em><strong>Laïka</strong></em>: the basic justification i could come up with was that with a two party system, both parties are incentivized to set their platforms to target specific groups to form majority coalitions<br>
<em><strong>Laïka</strong></em>: and that most of the concurrence on issues outside what’s important to those groups stems from sociological effects of party identification<br>
<em><strong>ALL NATURAL TOMFOOLERY</strong></em>: well, i think the conditions for winning are pretty important<br>
<em><strong>Laïka</strong></em>: that’s a good point<br>
<em><strong>ALL NATURAL TOMFOOLERY</strong></em>: you need that 50.1%, and when you’re in a two-party system, which our voting method guarantees<br>
<em><strong>ALL NATURAL TOMFOOLERY</strong></em>: the only contender to the 50.1% is the 49.9%<br>
<em><strong>ALL NATURAL TOMFOOLERY</strong></em>: so you could have a relatively homogenous voting population to start with<br>
<em><strong>ALL NATURAL TOMFOOLERY</strong></em>: but over time the two parties will seek every possible way to create a compelling dichotomy between the two<br>
<em><strong>ALL NATURAL TOMFOOLERY</strong></em>: that said, i do think there’s grains of truth to stereotypes about liberals and conservatives and there does seem to be some reflection of basic value systems<br>
<em><strong>ALL NATURAL TOMFOOLERY</strong></em>: so i wouldn’t say it’s entirely arbitrary, systemic, or sociological<br>
<em><strong>ALL NATURAL TOMFOOLERY</strong></em>: just mostly<br>
<em><strong>Laïka</strong></em>: woah new google results page<br>
<em><strong>Laïka</strong></em>: anyway<br>
<em><strong>Laïka</strong></em>: mostly i read something earlier that stated, basically, pundits pick candidates based on their stance on abortion and then write entire columns making “the case” for them<br>
<em><strong>Laïka</strong></em>: and i wondered which, if any, of my supposedly deeply held political convictions were actually ancillary to some specific cause<br>
<em><strong>Laïka</strong></em>: that caused me to identify with a party/set of values/belief system<br>
<em><strong>Laïka</strong></em>: and that if people are actually single-issue voters than it’d be trivial for parties to build, uh<br>
<em><strong>Laïka</strong></em>: alliances or whatever, the common word escapes me<br>
<em><strong>ALL NATURAL TOMFOOLERY</strong></em>: growing up i remember talking to my dad about abortion specifically as it relates to politics, and his stance was exactly what you might imagine<br>
<em><strong>ALL NATURAL TOMFOOLERY</strong></em>: he knew people in the church that “justified” their votes toward democratic candidates by pointing out that more social support leads to fewer abortions overall<br>
<em><strong>ALL NATURAL TOMFOOLERY</strong></em>: but he felt that he could only be morally genuine by voting based on principle<br>
<em><strong>ALL NATURAL TOMFOOLERY</strong></em>: if approaching any kind of conversation like that weren’t such a shitshow i’d love to return to it having the absurd quantity of statistics i know now about how abortion rates don’t even go down when it’s illegal<br>
<em><strong>Laïka</strong></em>: i wonder if your dad (just as an example) thinks that romney would be better for the economy<br>
<em><strong>Laïka</strong></em>: my guess is that he does, even if he can’t articulate why<br>
<em><strong>Laïka</strong></em>: especially* if he can’t<br>
<em><strong>ALL NATURAL TOMFOOLERY</strong></em>: i’m sure<br>
<em><strong>ALL NATURAL TOMFOOLERY</strong></em>: he’s against Obamacare too<br>
<em><strong>ALL NATURAL TOMFOOLERY</strong></em>: basically every typical conservative position, which i’m sure has a lot to do with my parents’ continued consumption of Fox News<br>
<em><strong>ALL NATURAL TOMFOOLERY</strong></em>: which i think brings up the other part of the two-party dynamic, that being the role of narrative<br>
<em><strong>ALL NATURAL TOMFOOLERY</strong></em>: if nothing else, Fox News does a really good job of driving the conservative narrative in America<br>
<em><strong>ALL NATURAL TOMFOOLERY</strong></em>: Nate sent me an article after the Biden debate, about <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2012/10/hack-gap-rears-its-ugly-head-yet-again">the Hack Gap</a>, which maybe you’ve heard of<br>
<em><strong>ALL NATURAL TOMFOOLERY</strong></em>: the thesis basically being that liberals don’t have people that are willing to just push the party line even when things are not quite what they want them to be<br>
<em><strong>ALL NATURAL TOMFOOLERY</strong></em>: as evidenced by the freak-out after the first debate, even though Obama really didn’t do that badly<br>
<em><strong>Laïka</strong></em>: interesting<br>
<em><strong>Laïka</strong></em>: i wonder if that’s a reflection of the underlying belief system<br>
<em><strong>Laïka</strong></em>: yielding to evidence rather than promoting prior judgment<br>
<em><strong>ALL NATURAL TOMFOOLERY</strong></em>: undoubtedly<br>
<em><strong>ALL NATURAL TOMFOOLERY</strong></em>: i think that’s one aspect where the stereotypes are more right than wrong, in that liberals by definition are more anti-authoritarian<br>
<em><strong>Laïka</strong></em>: it’s like the whole nate silver demonization<br>
<em><strong>ALL NATURAL TOMFOOLERY</strong></em>: which is one feature of the narrative that Fox has tried to co-opt in the Obama years, painting Obama as Orwellian, the conspiracy theories about FEMA camps, the sudden interest in civil liberties despite the fact that it was Bush that started the worst of it<br>
<em><strong>ALL NATURAL TOMFOOLERY</strong></em>: like, i see this a lot in my facebook feeds, my conservative friends and friends-of-friends dropping quips about how Obama is establishing a police state<br>
<em><strong>ALL NATURAL TOMFOOLERY</strong></em>: so i think although there’s certainly voters that so long as a candidate is anti-abortion, they’ll still vote for him, the larger strategy seems to be to craft a narrative that connects all of those things together simultaneously<br>
<em><strong>ALL NATURAL TOMFOOLERY</strong></em>: which is how being “un-American” became the worst thing anyone could call you<br>
<em><strong>ALL NATURAL TOMFOOLERY</strong></em>: it’s the whole narrative summed up in one word<br>
<em><strong>Laïka</strong></em>: the whole false equivalence of social and economic policy is really strange to me<br>
<em><strong>Laïka</strong></em>: it affects liberals as much as conservatives, too<br>
<em><strong>Laïka</strong></em>: like, obama has some really stupid positions on economic issues (lol manufacturing jobs)<br>
<em><strong>Laïka</strong></em>: which is certainly pandering to a specific subgroup, yet even some smart liberals act like it’s a critical policy goal<br>
<em><strong>Laïka</strong></em>: i wonder what the actual reason why i’m voting for obama is<br>
<em><strong>ALL NATURAL TOMFOOLERY</strong></em>: well, hasn’t it been shown that what candidates say in regards to economic policy – particularly during elections – has little to no reflection of actual policy?<br>
<em><strong>Laïka</strong></em>: probably<br>
<em><strong>Laïka</strong></em>: my hope is that if romney wins (he won’t) that he actually turns out to be a closet keysian and runs up the deficit<br>
<em><strong>Laïka</strong></em>: keynesian rather<br>
<em><strong>ALL NATURAL TOMFOOLERY</strong></em>: relevant<br>
<em><strong>ALL NATURAL TOMFOOLERY</strong></em>: <a href="http://gawker.com/5957733/romney-supporters-in-ohio-explain-why-their-candidate-deserves-to-win">http://gawker.com/5957733/romney-supporters-in-ohio-explain-why-their-candidate-deserves-to-win</a><br>
<em><strong>ALL NATURAL TOMFOOLERY</strong></em>: but yeah, obama isn’t perfect, and i’m sure after all this is over it’s gonna be back to groaning at stuff<br>
<em><strong>ALL NATURAL TOMFOOLERY</strong></em>: but all in all i’m pretty happy<br>
<em><strong>Laïka</strong></em>: so i like to have laughs at republicans for being anti-intellectual and rejecting scientific inquiry, eg polling data, if it doesn’t support their world view<br>
<em><strong>Laïka</strong></em>: but i wonder what the equivalent of that is on the other side<br>
<em><strong>Laïka</strong></em>: if it’s really just as simple as lampooning any idea that’s not self-evident<br>
<em><strong>ALL NATURAL TOMFOOLERY</strong></em>: well, that’s the tough part<br>
<em><strong>ALL NATURAL TOMFOOLERY</strong></em>: because a lot of people will see “obama is a communist” and “romney is a corporate sellout” as being equivalent statements<br>
<em><strong>ALL NATURAL TOMFOOLERY</strong></em>: that being, equally ridiculous/partisan/whatever<br>
<em><strong>Laïka</strong></em>: i guess i’m not really comfortable judging it as purely enlightened vs ignorant<br>
<em><strong>ALL NATURAL TOMFOOLERY</strong></em>: and i don’t think anyone should<br>
<em><strong>ALL NATURAL TOMFOOLERY</strong></em>: but ultimately you kind of have to make a choice about what you think is correct and incorrect<br>
<em><strong>Laïka</strong></em>: that’s the thing, like<br>
<em><strong>Laïka</strong></em>: i can make a relatively broad generalization that supports most of my political views, based on science and social progress<br>
<em><strong>Laïka</strong></em>: i want to feel like there’s a respectable opposing force that is equally intellectually grounded<br>
<em><strong>Laïka</strong></em>: which morality-by-fiat and rejection of science simply isn’t<br>
<em><strong>ALL NATURAL TOMFOOLERY</strong></em>: well, that’s the other thing that bothers me about public perception of politics<br>
<em><strong>ALL NATURAL TOMFOOLERY</strong></em>: barack obama probably manages to represent me on 55-60% of the issues i care about<br>
<em><strong>ALL NATURAL TOMFOOLERY</strong></em>: maybe even as low as 40%, since i’m already pulling numbers out of my ass<br>
<em><strong>ALL NATURAL TOMFOOLERY</strong></em>: but romney’s down there at 10%, maybe less<br>
<em><strong>ALL NATURAL TOMFOOLERY</strong></em>: i’m sure a third party candidate exists that i could write in that would get me up to 90% and beyond, but they’re not going to win, ever<br>
<em><strong>ALL NATURAL TOMFOOLERY</strong></em>: and i’m not going all-or-nothing<br>
<em><strong>ALL NATURAL TOMFOOLERY</strong></em>: politics, both for voters and for politicians, is the art of compromise<br>
<em><strong>ALL NATURAL TOMFOOLERY</strong></em>: doing it as efficiently as possible to generate the greatest utility<br>
<em><strong>ALL NATURAL TOMFOOLERY</strong></em>: i guess, for me, the utility part is what keeps me confident in my beliefs<br>
<em><strong>ALL NATURAL TOMFOOLERY</strong></em>: people don’t have to like any of the policies that i support, because i know that if i’m right, eventually they’ll shut the fuck up and accept that it’s better<br>
<em><strong>Laïka</strong></em>: i also tend to see at least a majority of my positions as being inevitable<br>
<em><strong>Laïka</strong></em>: i wonder if that’s universal<br>
<em><strong>ALL NATURAL TOMFOOLERY</strong></em>: i think that’s a trait of consciousness<br>
<em><strong>ALL NATURAL TOMFOOLERY</strong></em>: like, go read something you wrote 6 months or a year ago<br>
<em><strong>ALL NATURAL TOMFOOLERY</strong></em>: most of the time you find things you don’t quite agree with, decisions you’d make differently now<br>
<em><strong>ALL NATURAL TOMFOOLERY</strong></em>: with the really bad stuff it’s hard to read because you wonder how you were so stupid, but those aren’t things you’d have been able to conclude at the time<br>
<em><strong>ALL NATURAL TOMFOOLERY</strong></em>: point being, i think it’s inevitable for a given moment in time<br>
<em><strong>Laïka</strong></em>: is that at conflict with the sentiment that “the country is going down the drain”? do the same people hold both views?<br>
<em><strong>ALL NATURAL TOMFOOLERY</strong></em>: i think that’s just a reflection of how much of our perspective is self-generated/projected<br>
<em><strong>ALL NATURAL TOMFOOLERY</strong></em>: like, what you have there is pessimism + a narrative that says obama is ruining the country<br>
<em><strong>ALL NATURAL TOMFOOLERY</strong></em>: as much as i don’t like romney, if pressed i don’t think he would be the sole undoing of america<br>
<em><strong>ALL NATURAL TOMFOOLERY</strong></em>: two terms might be pretty bad, in the same way that bush was bad<br>
<em><strong>ALL NATURAL TOMFOOLERY</strong></em>: it’s a step further in a negative direction, but unlikely to be something that couldn’t be undone<br>
<em><strong>ALL NATURAL TOMFOOLERY</strong></em>: but humans are so fucking bad at prediction<br>
<em><strong>ALL NATURAL TOMFOOLERY</strong></em>: what does going down the drain even mean<br>
<em><strong>ALL NATURAL TOMFOOLERY</strong></em>: this isn’t the roman empire<br>
<em><strong>ALL NATURAL TOMFOOLERY</strong></em>: there are no huns at our doorstep<br>
<em><strong>ALL NATURAL TOMFOOLERY</strong></em>: (however much we might like to draw that metaphor)<br>
<em><strong>Laïka</strong></em>: virtually every time i hear that phrase used it’s from a christian value voter<br>
<em><strong>ALL NATURAL TOMFOOLERY</strong></em>: i remember when i used to watch fox, i think this was back in 2003 when the iraq war started, they were interviewing people at an iraq war protest<br>
<em><strong>ALL NATURAL TOMFOOLERY</strong></em>: and some middle-aged woman was crowing about how bush was worse than saddam hussein or stalin<br>
<em><strong>ALL NATURAL TOMFOOLERY</strong></em>: and while i find that statement slightly less ridiculous than whatever youtube gold we get from this election<br>
<em><strong>ALL NATURAL TOMFOOLERY</strong></em>: it’s not all that much better<br>
<em><strong>ALL NATURAL TOMFOOLERY</strong></em>: certainly not in touch with reality<br>
<em><strong>Laïka</strong></em>: i’m looking at this pew poll internals for religion and the only 3 categories are “protestant,” “catholic” and “unaffiliated”<br>
<em><strong>Laïka</strong></em>: i expect that the us will have a plurality of atheists by the time i die, and i wonder what the two party compositions will look like then<br>
<em><strong>Laïka</strong></em>: without such an easy crutch for parties to go after<br>
<em><strong>ALL NATURAL TOMFOOLERY</strong></em>: who the fuck knows, given the upcoming hispanic majority<br>
<em><strong>ALL NATURAL TOMFOOLERY</strong></em>: demographics are going to change so much, and i’m hesitant to say that religion will be politically irrelevant even by the time we die<br>
<em><strong>ALL NATURAL TOMFOOLERY</strong></em>: given that catholicism still carries some weight in hispanic communities<br>
<em><strong>ALL NATURAL TOMFOOLERY</strong></em>: which is thankfully not nearly as toxic as neoevangelical politics today<br>
<em><strong>Laïka</strong></em>: i think as the overwhelming majority starts to shrink, it becomes much less of an opportunity to draw distinction<br>
<em><strong>Laïka</strong></em>: so even if it’s still not irrelevant, it seems like it would become a less important factor in party affiliation<br>
<em><strong>Laïka</strong></em>: i’m sure that’s an optimistic view though<br>
<em><strong>ALL NATURAL TOMFOOLERY</strong></em>: well, that’s also the double-edged sword of a multi-party system<br>
<em><strong>ALL NATURAL TOMFOOLERY</strong></em>: i remember a few years back, my friend in the netherlands talking about how the neo-nazi party had just acquired seats in parliament<br>
<em><strong>ALL NATURAL TOMFOOLERY</strong></em>: which is something that wouldn’t happen in a 2-party system<br>
<em><strong>ALL NATURAL TOMFOOLERY</strong></em>: and it might just be a few seats, but it’s far from irrelevant once they’re in the building<br>
<em><strong>ALL NATURAL TOMFOOLERY</strong></em>: hm, you mind if i post this on the blog?<br>
<em><strong>ALL NATURAL TOMFOOLERY</strong></em>: i was going to write an election post<br>
<em><strong>Laïka</strong></em>: go ahead<br>
<em><strong>ALL NATURAL TOMFOOLERY</strong></em>: but this is way easier<br>
<em><strong>ALL NATURAL TOMFOOLERY</strong></em>: boss</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Recently, John Campbell, the author of my most favorite webcomic,&nbsp;<a href="http://archive.picturesforsadchildren.com/208/">pictures for sad children</a>,&nbsp;wrote a series of articles (for lack of a better word) that have generated some interesting controversy that’s relevant to my previous post about trolls. &nbsp;Although they’re an interesting read, the titles alone rather succinctly describe the content. &nbsp;The only background you need here is that John Campbell’s comics and street art are nothing if not&nbsp;<a href="http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3bb5i5jRs1qc45nxo1_r1_400.png">compulsively</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://archive.picturesforsadchildren.com/229/">melancholic</a>, but never, ever serious.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/73258510/sad-pictures-for-children/posts/311890">I’VE BEEN PRETENDING TO BE DEPRESSED FOR PROFIT AND I’M SORRY</a></li>
<li>He then posted&nbsp;<a href="http://picturesforsadchildren.com/post/31927077621">a list of creatives who are pretending to be depressed</a>&nbsp;(hint: none of them are)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/73258510/sad-pictures-for-children/posts/313179">I’VE BEEN PRETENDING TO BE PRETENDING TO HAVE DEPRESSION FOR PROFIT AND I’M SORRY</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/73258510/sad-pictures-for-children/posts/313853">IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PRETEND TO DO OR SAY ANYTHING AND MY COMICS HAVE NEVER BEEN ABOUT DEPRESSION</a></li>
<li>Lastly, a collection of responses:&nbsp;<a href="http://archive.picturesforsadchildren.com/alternativewaystothinkandfeelaboutthesituation/">ALTERNATIVE WAYS TO THINK AND FEEL ABOUT THE SITUATION/JOHN CAMPBELL’S JOKE IS STILL FUCKED UP</a></li>
</ul>
<p>His entire confession and apology was fake. &nbsp;A lot of his readers and fellow artists were pretty offended, and not unfairly – but one line in particular got me thinking.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I regret the borderline people, those who could identify the problems in their life, face them, and allow themselves to be changed, but instead found it necessary to conceive of themselves as “struggling with depression” rather than being genuinely held back emotionally by some nasty and real situation. Any work participating in the “culture of depression” has probably contributed to these sad and unnecessary cases.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>It’s no secret that mental disorders frequently revolve around creative individuals. &nbsp;It’s not just an assumption based on stories of overdosing rock stars and schizophrenic painters, but can even be seen based on the <a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0030405">the interests people express early in their lives</a>. &nbsp;Prevailing types of illness in certain demographics is one thing, but a culture of depression is quite another. &nbsp;Yet, my intuition says that there is something to this notion, though not in the context that Campbell has suggested.</p>
<p><strong>Creativity inspires dissatisfaction.</strong> &nbsp;In the visualization of alternative outcomes and realities, the imagination becomes fueled with notions of how the world could be different than it is. &nbsp;To look at the world in all its misery and decay, and to vividly see that this result was neither inevitable or necessary – that’s a hard juxtaposition to swallow every day. Ignorance is bliss, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Creativity alone does not empower.</strong>&nbsp; A key component of depression is powerlessness, an inability to exert control over one’s life. &nbsp;Seeing the problems of the world, and then witnessing tremendous apathy in the rest of mankind – or worse, passionate efforts to reverse progress – can make any&nbsp;person’s efforts feel insignificant and ineffective. &nbsp;Being able to imagine a solution is little consolation without the tools to bring that solution into reality.</p>
<p><strong>Creativity has no innate purpose.</strong> &nbsp;Not a cosmic meta-purpose, but the practical purpose that comes with knowing that something worthwhile has been accomplished, that value has been added to the world. &nbsp;Imagination is not itself a purpose or an end; satisfaction and meaning only come when something has actually been&nbsp;<em>created.</em> &nbsp;Thus the base of the word.</p>
<p><strong>Creativity is fickle.</strong> &nbsp;Inspiration comes and goes with the wind. &nbsp;Criticism can be brutal. &nbsp;Most people don’t give a shit. &nbsp;As a source of affirmation from others, creative expression is as unreliable as it gets.</p>
<p>Viewed like this, I think it’s not so ridiculous to suggest that a culture of depression would develop around creatives, whose identity and purpose rely on something that is as tempestuous as imagination. I find it unlikely that there are many people out there pretending to be depressed to fit in or to enhance their credibility, but I do see how the spread of depression would be enhanced by the way that creative skills has been positioned in society. &nbsp;That being, at odds with practical skills – the sort of skills that might save people from jobs they loathe, that provide daily challenge and mental stimulation. &nbsp;On top of this, most everyone wants to feel that they matter, that what they do is in some way meaningful to the rest of the world. &nbsp;It seems to me that rather than arbitrarily&nbsp;reassuring people that they’re special and that they belong in the world simply by being a human being, useful skills will reliably garner those affirmations without solicitation.</p>
<p>To illustrate, let’s try a hypothetical example. &nbsp;Take two guys in their mid-20’s, and maybe they’re both creative people. &nbsp;One did an apprenticeship program after high school and is now a certified electrician. &nbsp;The other spent four years at a liberal arts college and has acquired a bachelor’s in comparative literature. &nbsp;<em>Which one do you think feels more creatively fulfilled?</em></p>
<p>Talk to people in skilled trades and you’re going to hear a lot of positive things. &nbsp;They enjoy their work – it’s interesting, dynamic, and challenging. &nbsp;There’s no question about the meaning or importance of their work. &nbsp;More importantly, however, the electrician is going to be financially stable with a lot of available opportunities due to his income. &nbsp;He can travel, buy an instrument and take lessons, take night classes – the only limit is the energy he’s got left after a day of work. &nbsp;Meanwhile, the path ahead for complit guy is fraught with uncertainty, and not in the happy-go-lucky, “let’s roll the dice” kind of way. &nbsp;It’s not just about the money, though I’m sure complit guy isn’t feeling so hot about his student loan debt. &nbsp;There’s no jobs in the field he studied for – for that, he’d have to do grad school and run the gauntlet of finding a spot somewhere in academia. &nbsp;If he’s lucky, he can get an office job. &nbsp;If he’s not so lucky, he’ll be in retail or customer service. &nbsp;If he’s SOL, he’s unemployed and moves back in with his parents.</p>
<p>Young people are constantly urged to follow their dreams, and so they do – but the end result is frequently the opposite of the original intent. &nbsp;Unable to find jobs relevant to what they spent years studying, these dream chasers end up in fields far away from their passions, performing tasks they were probably just as well qualified for at the end of high school. &nbsp;Creative expression then becomes an outlet for misery in the midst of dead-end jobs, rather than a celebration of the human experience. &nbsp;My argument here certainly isn’t that the arts or humanities are fruitless pursuits. &nbsp;The problem is that areas attracting people with an interest in creative expression have been placed on a track that is exclusive from more practical skills. &nbsp;Ultimately, I feel like “culture of depression” is a bit of an overstatement for what occurs, but I do think there’s certain false dichotomies that perpetuate unhappiness among creative individuals – this being one of them.</p>
<p>As I continue to track down the mythical beast of Balanced Emotions, I’ve found that I have a tendency to amplify my own miseries by setting up arbitrary barriers. &nbsp;For a good while, I thought that I wasn’t meant to be programming because I’d discovered this creative side of myself, and that I needed to find Truly Creative ways to make my way in the world to be happy.</p>
<p>Yeah, I’m full of such horseshit sometimes.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>The last month has seen more activity in the Middle East, complete with <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/13/world/middleeast/us-envoy-to-libya-is-reported-killed.html?pagewanted=all">senseless murders</a> and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/15/world/middleeast/anti-american-protests-over-film-enter-4th-day.html?pagewanted=all&_moc.semityn.www">vast rioting</a>. &nbsp;Yet again, this has spurred a great deal of head-scratching as to how in the world a&nbsp;feeble&nbsp;insult in the form of a minute-long YouTube video could inspire such a response. &nbsp;The usual explanations are everywhere: large groups of unemployed and alienated young men, hyper-conservatism fostered through theocratic rule and aggressive media filtering, or America’s incomprehensibly bad relationship with the entire region – there’s so much to choose from. &nbsp; However, whatever the situation over there predisposes people to feel or do, the fact remains that hundreds of thousands of people were rioting about a YouTube video. &nbsp;I propose to you that it’s because they aren’t getting trolled frequently enough.</p>
<p><strong>Trolls are a vaccine for the social immune system.</strong></p>
<p>Trolls provide an everyday lesson in human interaction, demonstrating a number of important truths of communication:</p>
<ul>
<li>People don’t change their minds about important things very often, or very quickly</li>
<li>People often believe strange things for odd reasons, or sometimes no reason at all</li>
<li>Almost everyone thinks people that disagree with them are idiots</li>
</ul>
<p>The troll has no investment in or reason to defend her given stance – it’s entirely arbitrary. &nbsp;Without some kind of value judgment or formula of reasoning, there is no consideration of evidence and no use of logical reasoning – constructive discussion is just impossible. &nbsp;Arguing with a troll is, therefore, always a waste of time. &nbsp; The only sustainable long-term strategy is not to react, eliminating the incentive to troll by cutting the amount of attention she receives.</p>
<p>As it turns out, this is also the optimal strategy for dealing with the hyper-zealous. &nbsp;It’s hard to avoid taking the bait on topics we hold near and dear, but most often that’s the best outcome for everyone involved – especially if there is no established precedent of courtesy and respect. &nbsp;The only time people are looking for answers is when they’re asking questions. &nbsp;If they aren’t curious, they aren’t receptive to new ideas. &nbsp;Extreme beliefs are rooted in identity and social networks. &nbsp;They’re a core part of an individual’s narratives and assumptions about the world, all of which reinforce one another. &nbsp;Transforming worldviews is not something&nbsp;<a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-RmAScEQX54c/Tp7zgEVlO8I/AAAAAAAABgs/v27PuRIYNRc/">evidence and reason</a>&nbsp;are very good at doing, particularly in the short term. &nbsp;The end result here is the same: there is little purpose in argument, particularly if it’s emotionally charged. &nbsp;Without trolls, however, that’s not a conclusion most people will reach on their own.</p>
<p>Embarrassment is an extremely effective teaching tool. &nbsp;In public situations, what most people fear above all else is to be shamed, especially in front of their peers. &nbsp;An effective troll does exactly that, sending people into vitriolic conniptions over utterly meaningless material, making themselves look inane in the process. &nbsp;When the troll is revealed as being a troll, it becomes clear in a single instant that the victims have fallen for a ruse. &nbsp;Not only did they just waste hours – sometimes days – of their time arguing fervently for absolutely no purpose, they’ve made themselves look like idiots in the process. &nbsp;Anyone that’s fallen for trolls can attest – it’s not a lesson quickly forgotten, and that memory comes quickly to mind when knee-jerk responses begin to tempt. &nbsp;Trolls build up our immunity to the craziest ideas and most ridiculous statements. &nbsp;They provide a reason to stop and ask that most crucial question:&nbsp;<em>Is it worth it?</em></p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>I went to my first electronica concert a few weeks ago – but to describe it properly, I have to start from the beginning. &nbsp;The beginning of my love for electronic music, that is.</p>
<p>The first time I put a track on repeat was when I was 10 years-old. &nbsp;My dad had bought an album after hearing a song in a commercial; the album was from the electric quarter&nbsp;Bond, the album was their first – Born – and the track was <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIlLE-Lo3Kg">Alexander the Great</a>. &nbsp;It was arguably the closest thing to electronic music that I’d yet encountered, and it promptly crawled through my ears and&nbsp;into my soul. &nbsp;I was utterly smitten. &nbsp;I loved the whole album, actually, but I played that one track well beyond 10,000 times over the course of the following years. &nbsp;It had certain features that, as it turns out, are hallmarks of the music I love most today:</p>
<ul>
<li>buil<strong>d</strong>uP<strong>s</strong> <strong>a</strong>N<strong>D</strong> <strong>BR</strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCKpxG86aoM"><strong>EAK</strong></a>downs</li>
</ul>
<p>The song grows in intensity over time; this overall buildup is comprised of smaller peaks, valleys, and plateaus, but each segment ends with more energy and volume than when it began. &nbsp;Ultimately the song coalesces into a maelstrom of sounds and patterns layered over each other, repeated and intensified until the climax of the song is reached. &nbsp;That repetition is crucial.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOyU_OzRXnM">Repetition</a>. &nbsp;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOyU_OzRXnM">Repetition</a>. &nbsp;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOyU_OzRXnM">Repetition</a>.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>All music involves repetition. &nbsp;Electronic music tends to use&nbsp;<a href="http://xkcd.com/411/">a bit more of it</a>. &nbsp;Why? &nbsp;Because it’s made for dancing. &nbsp;Admittedly, Alexander the Great was not made for dancing, and the same is true for much electronica. &nbsp;The truth, however, is that electronic music was born in clubs and delivered by DJs on a mission to make people dance. &nbsp;People can’t dance to something they can’t predict on a moment-to-moment basis – this is why repetition is so important. &nbsp;Repetition is also a way to generate anticipation. &nbsp;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRLOwUZBQO8">The drop</a> – the moment of transition from buildup to breakdown – is an instantaneous release of that anticipation, and if you’re dancing, it’s positively euphoric. &nbsp;The drops in Alexander the Great (which aren’t particularly huge)&nbsp;are marked by a sample of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jh3kIi8ppeg">a guy shouting&nbsp;<em>“GO!”</em></a>. &nbsp;Combined with the rise and fall of energy throughout the track, simple phrases can carve out narratives amidst the&nbsp;cacophony&nbsp;of noises.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5sMlJOquhU"><strong>A different kind of narrative</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, there are narratives in electronic music, but they’re narratives driven by the experience the song creates, rather than stories told through lyrics. &nbsp;If words or phrases appear, they tend to allude to rather simple, self-contained ideas, often repeated throughout the buildup. &nbsp;Some voices are put into tracks only because <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bfseWNmlds">the voice sounds so good</a>.&nbsp; The words can be utterly meaningless or unintelligable, but they’re still able to communicate emotion and immerse you into a specific theme. &nbsp;It’s the kind of immersion where you don’t have to be told what to care about or why to care about it – it’s instinctual and immediately gripping,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oapDdRwlQ60">playing with your motor neurons</a>&nbsp;like an artisan puppetmaster. &nbsp;It doesn’t just infect your spine, though. &nbsp;It fuels the imagination in a way that ties your mind’s eye with the movement of your limbs. &nbsp;It’s like that feeling you might get while watching a great action movie that you’re really into; you’re right with the protagonist, dodging bullets, rolling with the punches, and kicking down doors. &nbsp;In this way, electronica achieves the ideal state for total sensory engagement: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">flow</a>.</p>
<p>Everyone finds themselves in flow from time to time – but there are varying degrees. &nbsp;The flow you sometimes experience while driving is not the same as the flow that comes from reading a good book, which is different still from the flow of great sex. &nbsp;The flow achieved while dancing is, in my mind, among the purest forms. &nbsp;It’s the most direct connection that can be made between your mind and your body; there are no tools required or abstractions that must be made to connect the action of moving your hand with its consequence. &nbsp;A&nbsp;state of flow that is nothing less than pure rhapsody and euphoria.</p>
<p>This is what Bond did to me at ten, and it’s the experience I’ve been endlessly hunting ever since. &nbsp;In this respect, I have become an expert hunter, now having dozens of hours worth of playlists, filled with nothing but tracks that I adore. &nbsp;Yet, there has been a measure of unfulfillment lingering with me all of this time. &nbsp;In all these years, I’d never been to a concert or a (real) club, places where the music is actually intended to be heard. &nbsp;This genre is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwzRLgJorYQ">made for dancing</a>, and not for dancing alone in your bedroom. &nbsp;Track after track are filled with references to being in the club, the palpable anticipation of the crowd as the drop is about to come, the surge of movement and energy as thousands of people instantly begin dancing their hardest at the command of a single DJ. &nbsp;All of these things are a part of the overall narrative in much of electronica, but up until a few weeks ago, were something that I was left to imagine, hoping that it was as lovely as I had always dreamed. &nbsp;So, when I had the opportunity to see Infected Mushroom at Terminal 5 in NYC, I was nothing short of thrilled.</p>
<p>There were two opening acts. &nbsp;The first was an indie electronic group that I didn’t find myself particularly engaged by. &nbsp;Towards the end of their performance I was actually becoming quite sad, as my experience was rather like that of other concerts I’ve been to, where I enjoy the music, but have no particular love for any aspect of the experience. &nbsp;I’d started to despair that this concert would be like all the others – but they left the stage, and the next opener was a trance DJ. &nbsp;Trance, if you are unfamiliar, is the most repetitive of genres in electronica. &nbsp;Trance producers don’t play individual tracks, but stream together ~80 minutes of songs in a seamless mix to facilitate a completely uninterrupted experience. &nbsp;Trance was the first truly electronic music I started listening to, as DJs have been releasing their sets for free on the internet long before other artists because their money is made on performance, not distribution. &nbsp;As a result, a large portion of my teenage years were spent listening solely to trance (until I discovered Infected Mushroom, actually), so to be present for a trance DJ was a highly unexpected surprise.</p>
<p>Everything’s about the mood, though, and it took me a while to recover from the gloom I’d acquired during the previous act. &nbsp;I’d heard most of the tracks he was sampling before, and I knew the formula that all trance DJs employ. &nbsp;Yet, within just a few moments, I was already finding myself melding with the rhythm; my feet were tapping, my knees were bouncing, and my neck was craning to and fro. &nbsp;It was barely five minutes later that I simply had to go down on the dance floor. &nbsp;Lest any fantasies be entertained, this crowd was mostly dudes – much as they are at many clubs. &nbsp;Anyone looking to get laid at a concert is in a sorry state of affairs, to be sure, but I was certainly not there for human eye candy. &nbsp;I was there to dance, and that’s what I did. &nbsp;It was a blissful 70 minutes, and I went all out for the entire duration, thinking that there would be some time in between acts to get some rest and drink some water. &nbsp;I was wrong. &nbsp;Barely two minutes after the trance DJ ended his set, Infected Mushroom came on stage.</p>
<p>First, let me explain a bit about modern electronic concerts, where <a href="http://videomapping.tumblr.com/">video projection mapping</a> has become a popular technique. &nbsp;A team of graphic designers make a video that’s&nbsp;<a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=4&cad=rja&ved=0CDsQtwIwAw&url=http%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F24502224&ei=vUZWUML-FtG60QHt7YH4AQ&usg=AFQjCNFoP9R90HiHEGV9I3g3Lda29B_NeA">built with a given space in mind</a>, and knowing the <a href="http://vimeo.com/41486619">dimensions and proportions of the area being projected</a> onto, they can create the illusion of three dimensions as well as movement within that space. &nbsp;Infected Mushroom does this with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AvjTkExkgM">two spheres on the stage</a>, combined with a screen behind the spheres. &nbsp;The video is designed specifically for the entire performance – the visual elements are tied in both rhythm and theme to the current song. &nbsp;The DJ – if he’s really good – will perform alongside the video, creating a complete audio-visual experience that is also a live performance. &nbsp;Some artists choose not mix live, and a lot of people have made a great big huff about how many EDM artists are “faking it” – but I consider this whole debate irrelevant. &nbsp;I’m there for the experience, not to pretend that I understand what’s going on behind the scenes. &nbsp;Music is music, as far as I’m concerned.</p>
<p>As Infected Mushroom started to play, I wasn’t sure how I was going to make it. &nbsp;I was already pretty sweaty and breathing hard from the trance act, and I had my messenger bag on me (with my tablet and a bunch of other shit), which was both a pain in the ass and a hindrance to my dancing. &nbsp;The dance floor had become absolutely packed, as everyone sitting on the sidelines for the trance act had now joined in, and there was barely room to move.</p>
<p>Yet, as soon as the first track began, there was no question: I would find the energy to dance to this. &nbsp;The volume was as loud as can be imagined; it drowns your ears, fills your lungs, and rattles your bones. &nbsp;The visuals were ineffable in their variety and creativity, showing off all manner of designs and patterns, moving and shifting perfectly in time to the beats. &nbsp;Balloons were released from the ceiling periodically, and as they fell, they would cross the path of the massive projector driving the show, temporarily acquiring a shifting mosaic of color while scattering the hues on the screen. &nbsp;Several fog machines were working full-time, blasting massive columns of smoke which would then mix with the flashing lights of every chromaticity, eventually dissipating in the path of the projector. &nbsp;Then, after all this – <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jznfI0O2v9E">there was the music itself</a>. &nbsp;I’ve never been to a concert where I could sing along to the lyrics – but here, I could, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5xCkgqR69U">and I knew every word</a>. &nbsp;Each time I thought I was done for, that I’d spent all of my energy and I was sure to collapse on the floor right there, another beloved track would come and restore me to full capacity.</p>
<p>By the end, I was drenched in sweat from head to toe, my whole body was quivering, and a grin was planted on my face that stayed with me for days. &nbsp;It was an experience that did more than meet my expectations. &nbsp;It was a glorious baptism of sweat, a confirmation of a decade-long suspicion that this was exactly the kind of experience I’d always wanted, a fulfillment of a dream that my passion for this music is not undeserved, that it is able to give back as much as I put into it. &nbsp;Probably the best fifty dollars I’ve spent in my life. &nbsp;I can’t wait to do it again.</p>

    <p>In general, I think Facebook is a good thing. It provides a way for people to stay in touch at all distances, it allows people to share cool and important things, and it provides a snapshot of what your peers value and desire. It does not, however, guarantee any kind of parity to reality. People assume that Facebook is showing real people and real lives because it’s real names that are popping up on their screen. What they forget is that Facebook is one giant filter of intention.</p>
<p>What shows up on Facebook is what people want to show up. Go look through your friend’s albums: how many weddings do you see? How many vacations? Babies? Trips abroad? Graduations? Visits with family? Parties with friends? There’s something missing from this picture. Like, say, people getting fired. Funerals. Arrests. Divorces. Suffice to say that we aren’t rushing to Facebook to tell everyone about our imperfections and admit that we’re not as happy as our pictures would have others believe. For the experienced netizen, this is business as usual. It’s a different story for the average Facebook user, however, and I’ve long pondered over how to challenge the way people perceive Facebook. Recently, I found a way.</p>
<p>As a kid, the game of the internet was always to appear older so as to enhance credibility, and the best way to do that was not to give anyone an excuse to look down on me. The first line of attack is always the display name, and by the time I was 13 I’d mostly standardized my name across the various mediums of the internet: <strong>salandarin</strong>. It was unique, didn’t have numbers (super important!), was easy enough to type, hard to say wrong, and carried a flavor of fantasy without sounding elven or magical. It’s austere and inert.</p>
<p>The preteen me wanted that because it provided a shield against scrutiny. Passivity is a great strategy for avoiding criticism, but it also leaves any hope of quality interaction in the hands my neighbors. Salandarin provided no material for conversation. However, as I became more engaged in online communities at the end of high school, I had earned a few nicknames. I started adopting them because they were flavorful and personal. Since 2008, my display name evolved thusly:</p>
<ul>
<li>salandarin</li>
<li>saladman</li>
<li>salad</li>
<li>sal</li>
<li>salmon</li>
<li>salmonesque</li>
<li>SALMONATOR</li>
</ul>
<p>I jumped between all of these sprodically for the next few years, using them for alts or special accounts, picking whichever seemed more thematically appropriate for the given environment. I could only have so many, however, as I still needed to log in to the accounts without going through the “Forgot your username?” prompts every time. But then sites started separating account name and display name. In particular, Steam eliminated all restrictions on what display name you could use. Duplicates were fine. Special characters were fine. Really long, or really short. It was all good. So, when I switched from HoN to DotA 2 and found myself using Steam a whole lot more, I realized I had a golden opportunity.</p>
<p>For the unfamiliar – Steam is a platform for playing video games. &nbsp;Your display name dictates what identifies you in the game. &nbsp;So, if my display name is SALMONATOR, it’ll tell everyone in the game “<em>SALMONATOR just got a double kill!</em>“, and it’s the name that appears in front of all chat&nbsp;messages. &nbsp; With that explained, here are just some of the names I’ve come up with over the last year. Yes, all of them were in caps, and I’m proud to say they’re all original.</p>
<ul>
<li>SALMONATOR</li>
<li>HEROIC SALMON</li>
<li>SMICKDASH</li>
<li>CHIROPRACTIC MANSLAUGHTER</li>
<li>PREMIUM FOOD STAMPS</li>
<li>GONNA POOP ON YA</li>
<li>IMPROMPTU BRODOWN</li>
<li>BUTT ALCHEMIST</li>
<li>PREHISTORIC MOP</li>
<li>JANITORIAL MASQUERADE</li>
<li>INTERSTELLAR VISIGOTH</li>
<li>SERF DUNKING</li>
<li>QUESTIONABLE OSMOSIS</li>
<li>LOBSTER CANNON</li>
<li>CAPTAIN THUNDERFUNK</li>
<li>SMUGFRUIT</li>
<li>FATSLAP</li>
<li>DUMPTURKEY</li>
<li>SPOONIST</li>
<li>SHAMBURGER</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of them are silly and lame. Some of them are alright. A few are hilarious. In general, though, a quirky and unique name goes a long way to breaking the ice in the garden of social butterflies that video gamers are known to be. &nbsp;I can hear people trying not to laugh when they say “dumpturkey” or “butt alchemist” over voice chat, and it’s absolutely great. &nbsp;Seeing “<em>GONNA POOP ON YA is GODLIKE!</em>” appear on the screen is just a delight. Anything that gets people to chill out and remember that it’s just a video game is a huge winner, and it makes the overall experience better for me (and hopefully others too).</p>
<p>But one of them took my heart above all others. For a game like DotA, <strong>CAPTAIN THUNDERFUNK</strong> was the greatest name I could ask for. It was loud and colorful without being pretentious. It matched my hyper-aggressive playstyle. It was easy to reference – <em>“CAPTAIN STOP FEED”</em> – and it allowed my occasional forays into energetic eccentricities to seem completely in-character (which, in real life, they are). People just seemed to like it.</p>
<p>There was a component of personal identity, as well. &nbsp;When I was in Berlin, I had the phenomenal experience of everyone assuming I was German. With my thick blond hair, fair skin, and fantastically German last name, I had to explain to a number of miffed train attendents and cashiers that I didn’t really speak much German. I really cherished those interactions because that’s just not something that happens in America. My German heritage is meaningless here. There is very little in the way of genetic or ethnic community for the progeny of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Anglo-Saxon_Protestant">suburban WASPs</a>, and this lack of individuality has vexed me for years. Captain Thunderfunk was exactly what I’d been looking for.</p>
<p>After a month or two, however, I started to feel the itch to move on. I loved the name, but I didn’t want to wear it out just playing DotA. As I perused Facebook one evening, I realized that there was no reason I couldn’t use Facebook the same way I was using Steam. It would just be a bigger challenge to find something that 300 people won’t roll their eyes at. The narcissism of the CAPTAIN was too overt; I needed something more approachable. &nbsp;It took me over three weeks of serious thinking to find the combination I was looking for – strange, as almost all of the above names were split-second creations.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CRANBERRY THUNDERFUNK</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In my mind, it’s perfect. It’s the most vivid nonsense phrase I’ve ever created. It can be anything: a fruity medly of electricity and groove, a futuristic dance move, a cyborg fungus from another dimension, or a weapon of mass flavoration. With minimal effort from the reader, a wide range of unique and badass imagery can be evoked from just two words. Next to my technicolor avatar, it generates an identity that is different from that of my name, yet is truer to my actual personality.</p>
<p>The response has been fabulous. I’ve gotten back in touch with a number of people who simply popped me a note to ask what the hell was up with the name. &nbsp;It’s a great starting topic of conversation for people I haven’t seen in a long time (they always ask!). &nbsp;It leaves me feeling more comfortable sharing more serious content on Facebook, as I know it’s counterbalanced by the absurdity of the name. Just as with video games, it seems to succeed at getting people to stop, even for just a split second, and ask themselves “<em>What the fuck</em>?”. &nbsp;I say that’s a beautiful thing.</p>
<p>The funny thing is that I actually felt a fair degree of anxiety prior to changing it. I was genuinely worried what everyone would think. I haven’t the faintest notion why.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>A foray onto the topic of gay marriage, inspired by the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/thebassoonista/posts/383376158383908?notif_t=share_reply">book of faces</a>. &nbsp;I’d like to take a look at a few ideas that seem to fuel much of the opposition to homosexuality.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strictly defined gender roles</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>I watched <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrsF7wyUxs8">a great Norwegian documentary</a> a few months back that investigated some of the dominant theory in psychology and sociology in Norway, where most explanations tend to favor nurture over nature in the development of the human psyche and society. &nbsp;Over the course of the series, he demonstrates how the desire to create total equality leads to dogma which rejects the possibility that people aren’t just blank slates. &nbsp;To the point: as much of the anecdotal evidence suggests, men and women are fundamentally different from one another in certain ways. &nbsp;This observation forms much of the basis for “ought” statements concerning the genders, but to stop here is to use incomplete evidence.</p>
<p>Although we generally perceive gender as binary, the reality is that it’s more like a spectrum. &nbsp;Masculine women and effeminate men are everywhere; some explain this as a byproduct of recent cultural shifts, but it’s true across all known cultures. &nbsp;It’s these cases that make “ought” statements about men and women rather hairy affairs. &nbsp;A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disorders_of_sex_development">large minority of the populace</a> <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-14459843">do not immediately fit rigid classification</a>, and it’s this demographic that suffers when society fails to acknowledge their existence. &nbsp;No, it turns out, nature is&nbsp;<em>not</em> as simple as boy and girl. &nbsp;But what does this have to do with homosexuality?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Universally applied expectations of relationships</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>As the perceived roles of men and women become more exclusive to one another, notions of what constitutes a valid and functional relationship begins to narrow. &nbsp;What results is a very specific definition of a successful relationship, one that tends to rely heavily on shared concepts of gender roles. &nbsp;Norms of gender are only effective in so far as most people are willing to enforce them or abide by them, which is why the slippery slope argument is so widely used. &nbsp;In a society where gender norms are no longer strictly enforced, individuals that rely on these norms to structure their relationships will probably feel threatened or undermined.</p>
<p>People generally look to history for confirmation of their notion that things are getting worse or that the game has fundamentally changed, but this analysis is nothing more than a post hoc fallacy. &nbsp;Just because our culture here in America has been structured to favor one man and one woman does not mean that all other combinations are in any way invalid or sub-optimal. &nbsp;The principles that govern heterosexual relationships are the same for homosexual relationships – and why should we expect any different? &nbsp;Sexuality and gender do not diminish the prime importance of communication, awareness, and patience, as well as all the other qualities that form the groundwork for a healthy relationship.</p>
<p>But why is homosexuality a target of such angst for the fundamentalists?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The origin of sexuality is considered irrelevant</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>For a long time people rejected the idea that sexuality was innate – gays were making a choice and were therefore at fault. &nbsp;Nowadays, there exists overwhelming data which indicates that for many people, sexuality is mostly determined in utero. &nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenatal_hormones_and_sexual_orientation">Testosterone modulates developmental changes</a> in the brain, transforming the structure of the brain (which starts female!) to a male-structured brain. &nbsp;The origins and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_sexual_orientation">demographics of sexuality</a> are important to consider if we want to know whether it’s actually a good or bad thing.</p>
<p>This is where it’s important to consider what percentages actually mean. &nbsp;Given that at least 3-4% of the American population identify as LGBT, that’s well over 10 million people, or somewhere around one in every 30 people you know. &nbsp;Many arguments suggest that current culture has encouraged its growth and that it used to be smaller, but there is no evidence for this; other countries across the globe show similar rates, even in places where it is still extremely taboo.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Homosexuality is considered synonymous with promiscuity</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe you’ve seen statistics like this before (this one’s all over faith-related websites):</p>
<p><em>“a 1978 study found that 75 percent of white, gay males claimed to have had more than 100 lifetime male sex partners: 15 percent claimed 100-249 sex partners; 17 percent claimed 250-499; 15 percent claimed 500- 999; and 28 percent claimed more than 1,000 lifetime male sex partners.”</em></p>
<p>Using this data (or similar), the conversation generally circles back to questioning the viability of homosexual relationships because they are not deemed monogamous. &nbsp;This is certified bullshit. &nbsp;Every study performed since has found a quite different result. &nbsp;In general, <a href="http://blog.okcupid.com/index.php/gay-sex-vs-straight-sex/">the vast majority of the LGBT</a>&nbsp;population <a href="http://timrfisher.tripod.com/dgstats.htm">nearly mirrors the behaviors</a> of the heterosexual population, and it’s a very small minority that end up accounting for a disproportionately massive chunk of sexual activity. &nbsp;This brings us to the last point.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lumping all sexual deviance into one group</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Driven by assumptions and inaccurate perceptions of the gay lifestyle, many moralists unflinchingly prophesize&nbsp;beastiality&nbsp;and orgies if we allows homosexuality to go on. &nbsp;The Boy Scouts of America still refuse to allow openly gay scouts or leaders, a policy fueled entirely by the notion that pederasty is standard homosexual behavior. &nbsp;All of it based on an inability to see gay people for the overwhelmingly normal folk that they are. &nbsp;With these associations cemented daily by religious and political leaders, fundamentalists at large learn to see gay marriage as a symbolic threat to the safety of their value systems, rather than the civil rights movement that it really is.</p>
<p>In my mind, it’s nothing short of a disgrace that so many continue to claim that there is no unfair discrimination in preventing gay marriages. &nbsp;There is no point in arguing whether there should or should not be legal benefits for marriage – there are, and they aren’t going away. &nbsp;Being as we don’t live in a theocracy, legal benefits should never be restricted based on sexuality. &nbsp;End of story.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>There’s a lot of work yet left to do, but so far I’m pleased with how things are coming along. &nbsp;From the design side of things, I want to convert the background to SVG so that I can take it to the next step, that being a dynamic and potentially interactive scene. &nbsp;I’ve had musings of changing it based on the tags within a given post, or perhaps animating the birds, waves, the sun, and so on. &nbsp;It’ll be a while before I get around to that, but I’m already getting a bit tired of the existing scene, so the clock is ticking. &nbsp;Moving on: thoughts after reading my entire blog from start to finish – the first time I’ve ever done so.</p>
<p>Memories are recorded very differently in words than in photos. &nbsp;I go through all of my pictures on facebook once a year or so – &nbsp;not as a ritual, but at some point I just find myself scanning through them, revisiting the progress of my life, trying to see what the pictures say about the names and faces contained therein. &nbsp;Photos capture moments, but they don’t immerse you into the time and place. &nbsp;They make that moment easier to access, but the only story they tell is the one you already know. &nbsp;Writing, on the other hand, is quite like a short film of thoughts and feelings, available to be re-experienced an infinite number of times. &nbsp;In this sense, I relived the last nine years of my life through the lens of my writing. &nbsp;It was more intense than I had expected it to be.</p>
<p>The first thing that struck me is how much about the last decade I’ve forgotten; for every detail I remember, there are a hundred that have fallen through the cracks. People that once stood as massive figures in my life, I realize haven’t occupied a single moment of my cognition in the last few years. &nbsp;Events that felt truly immense and defining at the time may well have been forever lost to memory had they not been written down. &nbsp;And then I think, <em>holy balls, I’m only 23</em>. &nbsp;Vast chunks of my life are already being lost to memory, and I have decades of existence ahead of me to experience and then promptly forget, forever. &nbsp;This realization has made me extremely grateful for this blog – my memory is far weaker than I imagine it to be, but the entries here remain unchanged from the day they were posted. &nbsp;Some of those entries are grossly embarrassing and reveal many of the worst truths about my character, but this, too, I am grateful for. &nbsp;Lest I fall into the trap of believing that I was ever any kind of avatar of excellence, this blog will exist to show me that I am no better than anyone else.</p>
<p>I have told myself over these last few years that I reinvented myself, that I willingly went through a metamorphosis to evolve past where I was as a youth. &nbsp;I generally marked the starting point of this as when I decided to leave the church – but reading through the years, I see that the transition was entirely gradual. &nbsp;I began as a fundamentalist, but after 3 years I started to reconsider many of the positions I’d been arguing so passionately for. &nbsp;Evolution was one of the biggest dominoes to fall, but a number of <a href="http://thelackthereof.com/2005/10/mmm-pie">tertiary</a> <a href="http://thelackthereof.com/2005/08/you-no-take-candle">social</a> <a href="http://thelackthereof.com/2005/07/the-one-redeeming-quality">issues</a> topple along the way. &nbsp;As my political views transitioned from conservative to liberal, I started to question the traditional neoconservative platforms, and by the end of high school my religion was divorced from my politics. &nbsp;This put me on the other side of the fence from much of my extended family, and was a major accelerant in pushing me to reconsider my moral platform as I began to identify the bigotry I once took as a badge of honor. &nbsp;In my mind, I have imagined all of this as happening over the course of just a year or two, but now, I can see that it was an incremental transformation over many years, the consequence of following the knowledge I was acquiring to its natural destination.</p>
<p>One painful feature I saw all along the way was the <a href="http://thelackthereof.com/tag/depression">constant presence of depression</a>, which grew in intensity over time. &nbsp;It’s hard to decide when it was truly at its worst; I could point to its venomous influence all along the way, but there are periods of time where it completely dominates both my writing as well as the events in my life. &nbsp;Much of it literally caused me to wince as I boasted how I made it through yet another week of school on just 10 hours of sleep, or when I obliviously describe episodes of serious mood swings and the problems they created in my relationships. &nbsp;I have to wonder how it went untreated for so long, when it was so absurdly obvious and omnipresent. I deem it unhealthy to dwell on such questions, however, and count myself lucky to have a better handle on it now.</p>
<p>Lastly, I greatly enjoyed watching the evolution of my writing. &nbsp;The first year was an unpleasant read; I had little to say and few words to say it in. &nbsp;Things improved when I found the topics that I enjoyed writing about. Originally this was exclusively video games, but my religious fervor pushed me to post some more controversial content. &nbsp;The response I got – a lot of which was very angry – pushed me to refine my ideas and presentation. &nbsp;As time went on and life started providing genuinely unique content to share with other people, I had the perfect medium to share those events with other people. &nbsp;The post I wrote for the <a href="http://thelackthereof.com/2005/07/pro-suus-a-regina">death of my dog, Daisy</a>, still chokes me up. &nbsp;The story of when <a href="http://thelackthereof.com/2005/11/the-sad-sad-clown">an old Russian guy dressed me up like a clown</a> still cracks me up. &nbsp;They’re sandwiched between high school nonsense and zealotry, but nevertheless decent content starts to crop up, and over time a larger proportion of entries manage not to be awful, and a few manage to be pretty decent. &nbsp;It’s fun to experience 9 years of improvement crammed into a handful of hours, and it gives me hope for the quality of my writing into the future. &nbsp;It also serves as a reminder that some of what I write today, I’m going to look back on and cringe – but that’s okay. &nbsp;It’s part of the learning process.</p>

    <p>I did it. &nbsp;Sweet mother mary on a sesame seed bun,&nbsp;<em>I did it</em>. &nbsp;All 627 posts have been categorized and tagged. There’s a few stragglers that I have to take care of due to some database errors, but 99% is close enough for now. Image and text links have been&nbsp;successfully&nbsp;restored for about half of the posts. &nbsp;It took a solid 15 hours of work, but for the first time, most of the content on this blog is once again properly viewable and accessible.</p>
<p><strong>Categories and tags</strong></p>
<p>Until I find a decent method of displaying tags (I hate tag clouds), only the categories will be accessible. &nbsp;I tried to be as consistent as possible, but it’s no small task. &nbsp;“life” ended up being my catch-all category (since I didn’t want anything uncategorized). &nbsp;Everything from 2005 and back is under high school; after that point, I start using it less frequently once I was writing posts that weren’t just standard teenage blather. &nbsp;There are some humor tags, but I also attempted to identify certain common threads. &nbsp;Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://thelackthereof.com/?tag=surveys-quizzes">surveys &amp; quizzes</a>&nbsp;– a tribute to the many “Which anime angel are YOU?” quizzes I took</li>
<li><a href="http://thelackthereof.com/?tag=now-all-i-need-is-a-girlfriend">now all i need is a girlfriend</a>&nbsp;– when the biggest problem in my life was being a virgin</li>
<li><a href="http://thelackthereof.com/?tag=skool">skool</a>&nbsp;– the days when i thought it was “kool” to spell school incorrectly</li>
<li><a href="http://thelackthereof.com/?tag=linkin-park">linkin park</a>&nbsp;– CRAAAAWLING IIIIIIN MY SKIIIIIIN, THESE WOOOOUNDS THEY WIIIIILL NOT HEEEAAAAALL</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Images</strong></p>
<p>If you look at the categories, media -&gt; photos will take you to some of the picture posts over the ages. &nbsp;For about half of these, the pictures may be lost forever; I tagged them anyways because I’m still holding out hope that I can find them somewhere (I’ve got an IDE hard drive sitting in my attic that belongs to my first computer – possible gold mine). A few of the more worthwhile posts:</p>
<ul>

<p><strong>Conversations</strong><strong></strong></p>
<p>A number of posts in 2004 were IM chat logs I posted where I proudly carried my anachronisms into the battlefield of teenage debate. &nbsp;Some of them survived, but about half of them appear to be irrevocably lost because I posted them to an “archive” blog (I remember nothing about this) which I somehow ended up losing or deleting. &nbsp;I also failed to find my final paper for my global studies class wherein I wrote 12 pages (for a 6 page assignment) championing climate change denialism. &nbsp;I mourn the loss of these relics, and hope that I can find them again some day. &nbsp;I know that some of you have made backups of my blog to make sure I never take any of this stuff down to pretend it never happened – if you happen to have saved any of this content, I’d sure love to have it again.</p>
<p>Aside: I saw my teacher (Shenk) for that global studies class at a softball game last year. &nbsp;She didn’t recognize me, but I told her who I was and apologized profusely for making her suffer through that paper. &nbsp;She seemed grateful.</p>
<p><strong>Comments</strong></p>
<p>The biggest task remaining is the integration of the old comments. &nbsp;These comments are stored in 4 massive XML files; I’m not even sure how to reliably match the comments with the associated post yet. &nbsp;If anyone’s curious, these are the 4 files (I linked them in the previous post but the links have changed):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://thelackthereof.com/docs/export_1.xml">http://thelackthereof.com/docs/export_1.xml</a></li>

</ul>
<p>I’m currently teaching myself PHP and SQL for work, so hopefully in a few months I’ll have the skills necessary to accomplish this. &nbsp;That said, I would really not be opposed if someone decided to craft me up a half-Christmas present and figured a way to transfer these. &nbsp;There’s some pretty amazing dialogue contained in there, and at least half of the spirit of the blog’s earliest years played out in the comments. &nbsp;This was, at one time, an incomprehensibly popular place.</p>
<p>More thoughts to come on this entire project. &nbsp;It’s been pretty fascinating.</p>
<p>EDIT: Comment displays for current articles are still not very attractive, but they’re at least functional.</p>
<p>EDIT<sup>2</sup>: That search function is excellent.  Try searching for your name, it works pretty damn well.</p>

    <p>Going through old posts is getting harder. &nbsp;I’m halfway through 2006, and the decent pieces of writing are becoming more sparse. &nbsp;I’m having to resist the urge to throw down “bullshit” and “pseudo-intellectualism” tags left and right. &nbsp;Even more tempting is the desire to censor the stuff that really makes me groan. &nbsp;In a few cases I have changed things that I realize, now, are not ideal to have sitting on a blog, but so far I’ve refrained from eliminating stuff just because it’s embarrassing. &nbsp;If I were to start doing that, I might as well just start over on <a href="http://bloglomerate.com/">another blog</a>.</p>
<p>Tagging has proved to be a challenge in and of itself. &nbsp;Finding a consistent schema for labeling posts is no small task when faced with such a large volume of material. &nbsp;Variety of topic isn’t the problem, but the different style of presenting and discussing content. &nbsp;The further back I go, the more willing I am to post incomplete work because my thought process didn’t take me any further. &nbsp;These days, I seem to be very firmly planted in an essay or chapter format, where a given post is focused on one concept and meant to stand completely on its own. &nbsp;This was not always so. &nbsp;I’m noticing that I often kept multiple lines of discussion going at the same time, exploring each in their own paragraph or two, sometimes trying to create a common thread between them and other times not. &nbsp;It gets hard to categorize a post that broaches a dozen or more of the tags I’ve been using.</p>
<p>Still, I’m excited to have some organizational structure going on. &nbsp;Each category is becoming its own story of how my personality and values have changed over time, along with fairly regular tidbits about major news events or cultural blips going on at the time. &nbsp;It’s greatly satisfying to see that I’ve developed answers for many of the vexing questions I frequently pondered, and to remember how many of the absurd worries I had back then are no longer relevant to my life at all. &nbsp;Being able to see that gives me renewed interest in keeping it strong. &nbsp;If the data is already getting rich at 9 years, I can’t wait to see what it will be like at 20 and 30. &nbsp;Will children of the future read the blogs their parents wrote at their age? &nbsp;I suppose it’s a bit narcissistic to desperately hope my progeny will read all of this with great interest, but that seems like a potentially phenomenal victory for the digital age. &nbsp;Completely lossless transmission of massive information across generations.</p>

    <p>After 9 years on Blogspot/Blogger, I’ve finally made the transition to a completely self-hosted blog ala WordPress. &nbsp;Blogger served me well for that time, but the newer templates were not intuitive or comprehensive, didn’t grant the precise control I wanted, and the older template was, well,&nbsp;<em>old</em>. &nbsp;Doing something as simple as making post titles link to post pages was not possible without custom scripting.</p>
<p>Currently there are still some broken and unfinished things.</p>
<ul>
<li>Comments</li>
</ul>
<p>The comments&nbsp;<em>work</em>, even if they look hideous and are kind of unreadable. &nbsp;Ultimately I’d like to merge <a href="http://thelackthereof.com/export.xml">the</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://thelackthereof.com/export.xml">oldest</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://thelackthereof.com/export.xml">comments</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://thelackthereof.com/export.xml">in</a>&nbsp;– these are from the days when I used a third-party pop-up commenting system (because Blogspot didn’t have commenting, in the beginning).</p>
<ul>
<li>Post formatting</li>
</ul>
<p>Practically all of the posts transferred with minimal harm, but some formatting was lost – mostly bold and italics, some spacing, and so on. &nbsp;Nothing that will make anything unreadable. &nbsp;I’m fixing these errors as I find them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Categories &amp; tags</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m slowly making my way through all of my posts adding categories and tags. &nbsp;It’ll be a while before I complete that for all 630 posts, but it’s an exciting feature to unlock. &nbsp;You’ll be able to select “high school” and immediately see all of the posts from that time period. &nbsp;I feel a little queasy knowing that all of that material is going to be much easier to browse, but I’ve promised myself (and others) not to hide the shame of my past. &nbsp;It is good not to forget.</p>
<ul>
<li>Old image links</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ll also be attempting to restore the broken image links in older posts – such as, for example, the once-popular Iraq prison camp post. &nbsp;I still have all of the original images for my previous posts, but they still need to be uploaded and then the URLs updated.</p>
<p>There’s more, too, but I’m out of time for the moment.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>I attended a forum at Cornell a few months ago, framed as a dialogue between two scientists, one Christian and the other atheist. To be frank, the entire thing gave me a headache. I was disappointed at both sides, but for quite different reasons.</p>
<p>The Christian plasma physicist Dr. Ian Hutchinson spent much of his time railing against a notion which he described as “scientism”, the philosophical belief that the only valid source of knowledge is scientific inquiry. At no point did he name any relevant person or theory that could be accurately categorized as submitting to this fallacy, but he was nevertheless quite passionate in ridiculing it. Following this, he then claimed that there exists no conflict between science and faith, going so far as to admit that he believes the laws of nature can be broken at any time and place.</p>
<p>To my great frustration and disappointment, his atheist partner in this discussion, Nobel laureate Dr. Roald Hoffmann, failed to counter Hutchinson at any of these junctures. What’s worse, Hoffmann abandoned a number of key epistomelogical pillars of secular humanism, stating that he felt analyzing and describing human behavior at the level of neurons and neurotransmitters was overly reductionist and threatened to destroy the magic of such experiences as beauty and love. Although I would like to take the time to expound more on reductionism, it is outside the scope of my current focus.</p>
<p>My problem with Hutchinson’s argument is quite simple: he created a very plush strawman in scientism and proceeded to whip it mercilessly. If this were just a footnote in his proposal, there would be no qualm here. Unfortunately, <a href="http://www.asa3.org/ASA/PSCF/2007/PSCF6-07Hutchinson.pdf">Hutchinson places scientism as the primary source of conflict between science and faith</a>.</p>
<p><em>“There is an intellectual confrontation that could reasonably fit the warfare metaphor. It is not between science and theology, however. It is between scientism, the predominant faith of the twentieth-century academic, and other faiths, including Christianity.”</em></p>
<p>The notion of scientism finds its roots in common stereotypes about intellectuals, academia, and science in particular. It’s another version of the Ivory Tower: modern scientists are disconnected with reality and fail to consider the existence of the rest of the world in their arguments and epistemologies. This is by no means a baseless accusation – science is currently doing a piss-poor job of making itself accessible to the public and academia is elitist practically by definition. Then there’s the general prevalence of agnosticism and atheism in scientific fields – only 7% of natural scientists in the National Academy of Science <a href="http://www.stephenjaygould.org/ctrl/news/file002.html">identify as holding a belief in a personal God</a> (contrary to what Hutchinson says). It is in this observation that I believe Hutchinson bases his claim that the modern academic can be characterized as subscribing to scientism.</p>
<p>Yet, I would firmly say that no intellectually legitimate scientist believes that only science is capable of discovering real knowledge, just as no intellectually legitimate Christian believes that Christianity has a monopoly on truth. Certainly, individuals of such a variety exist in both camps, but so ignorant a stance can be immediately dismissed as hogwash. A cursory glance at history can provide incontrovertible evidence of individuals across every spectrum of belief that successfully manage to further human knowledge and ingenuity. Our ancestors were not using the scientific method when they figured out how to domesticate animals, nor did whisperings from the gods inspire the discovery of the Golden Ratio.</p>
<p>Science is a methodology, a process, a strategy for engaging in inquiry and producing accurate results and reliable predictions. I do not need the scientific method to determine that I am a 23-year old male because I have a completely different set of tools (e.g. memory, perception, emotion) with which to answer that query. Part of the human challenge is picking the right tool for the job. The scientific method is probably not the right way to determine if you should get married, just like how your emotions are generally not the best tool to decide which stocks to invest in.</p>
<p>For all the time Hutchinson spends attempting to define science, there exists a quite simple distinction that he fails to mention: falsifiability. It is not possible to prove that something does not exist (proof by a negative), which is why science will never be able to demonstate that there are no gods, that miracles cannot or never have occurred, and that angels and demons do not accompany us everywhere we go. It is the nature of these concepts that they are untestable; as such, it is not possible for science (nor anything else) to make any definitive claims concerning them.</p>
<p>The conflict between science and faith that Hutchinson seeks to explain is quite easy to see, in this light. We have a profession whose progress (and very existence!) depends upon working exclusively with concepts that can be falsified; is it any surprise that these individuals would not subscribe to a set of ideas that are categorically unfalsifiable? Hutchinson’s comment on this is woefully unsatisfying.</p>
<p><em>“Why, if there is a God, does he not make himself scientifically provable? Why does God seem to be only rather obliquely discoverable in science? A big part of the answer, I maintain, is that a transcendent God can never be scientifically testable, for otherwise he would not be transcendent.”</em></p>
<p>Hutchinson’s (circular) argument rests upon the fact that there exist many features in our daily reality that are not scientifically testable, but are nonetheless quite real. The example he uses is love; indeed, there are no tests to prove or disprove one’s love for another. This does not mean you accept it without evidence. If you say you love someone, there is an expectation that your actions will conform to some ideal of loving behavior. Given time and persistence, it becomes so obvious that it would be foolish to deny the existence of that love.</p>
<p>This is, however, not proof. You might describe someone’s love as being a fact, but this is an expression of certainty, not truth. Love is not falsifiable, and that is in fact one of its qualities; by nature of being uncertain, love requires the development of <strong>trust</strong>. Trust is not binary; you might trust your lover more than you trust your boss, but that does not mean you do not trust either person. Instead, trust is probabalistic. How likely is it that they’ll be on time? That they’re telling the truth? That they’ll be faithful to you? The answers to these questions form the basis of certainty.</p>
<p>This is what makes love different from the existence of God. You might not be able to devise a de-facto test for love, but each of us have developed our own tests for accurately determining its presence with some certainty. The same is not possible for God. There are no questions that may be asked or tests that may be performed which bring one any closer to knowing, with any more certainty, anything about God. It is not scientism that creates the divide betwen science and faith, but faith’s reliance on unfalsifiable concepts of fundamentally indeterminate probability.</p>
<p>It may very well be the case that God exists and actively intervenes in the real world, but has deigned to make his presence untestable by all of the greatest minds and methods throughout history. This seems, to me, to be <em>vanishingly unlikely</em>. Knowing the tendencies of human beings, with our propensity to cognitive bias, the strength of social reinforcement in maintaining belief, and our general tendency to stick with the ideas with which we were raised, I have yet to find evidence worthy of the kind of trust necessary to overcome such astronomical odds. It is, in the end, trust that has determined my faith (and the lack thereof).</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p><em>Another thing I wrote for this lame psych class. The prompt this time: <strong>why is depression &amp; its treatment so popular in American society?</strong></em></p>
<p>For better or worse, America is a highly individualistic society. Self-reliance is generally considered to be a major virtue. Once an adult, an American is expected to provide for him or herself with minimal dependence on family or friends. In general, people who have not attained the expected level of independence are considered lazy or slothful. A failure to perform well in school or work is usually called a flaw of that person’s work ethic before anything else. In short, Americans tend to believe that most of a person’s successes and failures are up to that individual, and too much help will make them weaker and dependent. While these beliefs have probably helped maintain strong economic performance, they have encouraged behaviors and attitudes that leave Americans vulnerable to psychological instability.</p>
<p>Historically, it has been the case that one’s lot in society was determined by two things: gender and family. Men inherited the profession of their fathers. Women were allowed to perform a narrow set of tasks outside of child-rearing. Marriages were arranged, and property – if any at all – was inherited. Today, we have more freedom than at any other point in history. Freedom is a beautiful thing – but with freedom, comes choice. It’s not just choosing clothes or cars, but professions, spouses, homes, and educations. The social psychologist Sheena Iyengar has done <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/sheena_iyengar_on_the_art_of_choosing.html">some fascinating research</a> on the problems of choice overload, and her studies show that we become poorer decision-makers in the face of bountiful options.</p>
<p>“<em>[Americans] think that choice, as seen through the American lens, best fulfills an innate and universal desire for choice in all humans. Unfortunately, these beliefs are based on assumptions that don’t always hold true in many countries, in many cultures.</em>”</p>
<p>In the past, these choices were all made for us, and these are the choices that determine our role in society. Our role is what gives us purpose, that reason to get out of bed in the morning. When we don’t know our role, we are at risk of drifting aimlessly. This is a concept known as anomie, or normlessness. As much as we might like to believe that we decide our own fates, the truth is that we often need to be told what to do, or at least given a hint or two. Part of how we figure out how to do that is through our social circles – friends and family. But the American way is to disperse wide and far across the country, away from those who might know and understand us best. Friends and family are rarely considered in decisions about where to live or look for a job.</p>
<p>Barring any major disabilities, living with one’s parents past the early 20’s is often considered to be a sign of weakness, and past the 30’s it is almost anathema. Yet, in many other countries, it is the norm for multiple generations of a family to live together or in very close proximity to one another. American culture simply does not value familial bonds as highly as other cultures. It is common for children to take jobs that move them far away from not just their parents, but also their siblings, making frequent visits difficult or impossible. This distance from siblings is extremely important; studies have shown that relationships are among the strongest drivers of long-term happiness, and relationships with siblings are among the most powerful we can have. One study, <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2009/06/what-makes-us-happy/7439/">the Harvard Grant Study</a>, followed 268 Harvard graduates from the 1930’s up to 2010, checking in every few years to see how they were doing.</p>
<p>“<em>‘The men’s relationships at age 47, he found, predicted late-life adjustment better than any other variable, except defenses. Good sibling relationships seem especially powerful: 93 percent of the men who were thriving at age 65 had been close to a brother or sister when younger. In an interview in the March 2008 newsletter to the Grant Study subjects, Vaillant was asked, ‘What have you learned from the Grant Study men?’ Vaillant’s response: ‘That the only thing that really matters in life are your relationships to other people.’</em>”</p>
<p>For many, therapy becomes the only immediate option to replace these relationships. Multiple therapists have told me that some of their patients really just need friends. This is not to suggest that most depression is just a result of not having good relationships. I do believe, however, that the structure of American society makes Americans vulnerable to depressive attitudes and behaviors. The behaviors of depression are strongly self-reinforcing; poor sleep patterns can encourage anti-social behavior, poor eating habits can exacerbate anxiety and fear. Without trustworthy people nearby to interfere in our lives, we become prone to doing whatever we feel like. For many people – myself included – the tendency is to feel like doing nothing. The cycle begins there.</p>

    <p>In economics, an object’s liquidity is described as how easily it can be converted into currency without loss of value. I’d like to propose that the internet makes use of a similar concept in how information is distributed and exchanged. <strong>Information liquidity</strong>.</p>
<p>Here’s a pre-internet example before we dive in. Say you’ve written a book, and now you want people to read it. To do that, you need a publisher that will first print a large quantity of copies of your book, and then distribute those copies to locations that place your book in close proximity to the largest quantity of people (book stores and libraries). Next, potential readers have to be made aware of the existence of your book, as it’s not enough for it to just be available. There are thousands of books in even the smallest book store, and people aren’t just going to magically know that your book has been added to the collection. Publicity or advertising in one form or another will be necessary.</p>
<p>If the currency of the internet is viewership (and certainly other possibilities exist, but that’s outside the scope here), I would describe the liquidity of a site in terms of how easily it can generate viewership. A site’s liquidity is determined by how accessible it is from the user’s <em>current location</em>. One factor is by the quantity of links that are directed to that location across the internet – the probability of any user ending up at a given site increases as more links to it are made. Another factor of liquidity is through the minimum number of links that must be traversed before reaching a given site.</p>
<p>Described numerically, a site’s liquidity is the inverse of the number of links required to reach it. For users already familiar with a site, its liquidity is naturally 1 because they are likely to have its address memorized. As such, the analysis here is not concerned with content already familiar to users, but that content which is unknown to users. For sites which have no links or have not been indexed, their liquidity would be 0. Everything else falls somewhere in between.</p>
<p>Without search engines indexing much of the internet, a great deal of content would be mostly inaccessible except through very specific avenues. With search engines, however, the minimum distance can be as short as just one or two links, depending on the search criteria and accuracy. Considered like this, Google is the world’s largest information liquidator. Google also provides temporary information liquidity through advertisements, which serve both to increase the number of links to a site while also reducing the average distance from a user’s location to a site. The flip side to this is that search engines aren’t a destination. Ignoring Google’s other services, the probability that a user will traverse from google.com to not-google.com is nearly 100%.</p>
<p>What about social networks, then? They provide information liquidity, but certainly not to the same extent that a search engine does. Social networks aren’t crawling the web for content to index; they’re limited only to what its users are sharing through their service. The liquidity they offer also has a very short expiration date. Content has <em>at most</em> half a day of direct exposure, and long-term accessibility is mostly out of the question (especially given that Facebook and Twitter prevent Google from indexing their content). Still, social networks consistently generate large quantities of content with minimal user input, while also providing a lot of temporary liquidity for off-site content. They manage to be destinations as well as gateways.</p>
<p>The last example I’d like to touch on is video games. It may seem a case of apples and oranges next to social networks and search engines, but they represent one of the purest forms of destination on the internet. Video games decrease the liquidity of nearly all information that exists outside their networks. It’s difficult for two players in different video games to communicate with one another; video games are effectively islands of interaction. Problems exist for intracommunity engagement, as well; few video games support robust linking mechanisms such as might be found in traditional instant messaging – they just aren’t the ideal place to be sharing articles or videos. That said, services like Steam restore some of this liquidity by providing a cross-game mechanism for communication. This may also help to explain the wide appeal of MMOs, as they provide the satisfaction of playing a video game while limiting the information (and social) isolation that is commonly associated with video games.</p>
<p>The next concept in this scheme I’m looking to develop is traversal probability. I recognize that measuring user-link distance is insufficient to describe liquidity, and this is for two reasons. First, not all links are equal. The top result from a search is vastly more accessible than those that appear on the following pages, to provide just one example. Factors such as reputability, clarity, and visual prominence come into play. Second, the identity of the user greatly influences which type of links end up having the greatest appeal. Male users are going to have different behavior than female users. Danish users are going to have different behavior than Brazilian users.</p>
<p>If I’m on the right track, I think this is what I was attempting to measure in my previous graph.</p>
