                <p>This is the personal blog of Tim, who sometimes calls himself Cranberry Thunderfunk. Here, Tim writes on anything he has enough inspiration to finish a post on. That usually ends up being matters of science, pop culture, technology, religion, and philosophy.</p>
                <p>This blog is around ten years old, which is over a third of Tim's current age.  Back in 2003, it was called "Of Tim: Tim's life - or lack thereof", and it was as bad as you might expect the blog of a freshman in high school to be. Tim hopes that his writing is a little better, these days.</p>
